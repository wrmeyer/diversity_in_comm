Luthra, Rashmi ,,"""The continuing tension between the necessity and impossibility of translation is explored within the context of the Kashmiri movement for self-determination. In this situation of conflict, the central term azadi is intensely contested, with different parties to the conflict inflecting the term with their own politically motivated interpretations. In addition, the act of translation itself becomes politicized, with the Indian government, the Indian mainstream press, and minorities within Kashmir insisting that Kashmiris reveal the """"real"""" meaning of azadi and Kashmiri protestors refusing to pin down its meaning, using its polyvalence as part of the movement repertoire. In this fraught situation, engaged translation by progressive intellectuals is necessary to move beyond mutually exclusive interpretations of azadi so that new futures for Kashmir can be imagined.""","| Univ Michigan Dearborn, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA (1)",Perils of Translation in a Conflict Situation: Lessons from Kashmir,"Luthra, Rashmi (1)","azadi,Kashmir,social movement,independence,translation,conflict",2016,2016,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,WOS:000386488100001,TRUE,245,,5.88,0,88.42,0,4.96,0,"Univ Michigan Dearborn, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA",API,,1

Briones,Rowena L.,10.1016/j.pubrev.2010.12.006,"Forty individuals from the American Red Cross were interviewed to explore the use of social media in communicating with key publics. Results show that practicing public relations through social media is effective and necessary in the emerging digital age, as shown through the Red Cross' development of a two-way dialogue with younger constituents, the media, and the community. This two-way dialogue has been accomplished primarily through Twitter and Facebook, with barriers such as lack of staff and time, and opportunities to improve National Headquarters and local chapter relations. The insights shared by the American Red Cross are useful for both public relations scholars and professionals to help them understand and apply social media practices to build strong, lasting relationships.

Jian, Guowei ,10.1177/0893318912440178,"In spite of immigrants' growing role in the workforce of the United States and other developed countries, organizational communication research about the experience of immigrant employees in the host culture is still very limited. Drawing on the bidimensional acculturation theory, the purpose of this study was to investigate the association of acculturation of immigrant employees with three types of workplace relationships: leader-member exchange (LMX), coworker, and mentoring relationship. Based on a survey of immigrant employees in a U.S. Midwestern city, the study reveals that the two dimensions of acculturation, adjustment to one's host culture and retention of one's original culture, are differentially related to the three types of workplace relationships. Both theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in the study.","| Cleveland State Univ, Sch Commun, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA (1)",Does Culture Matter?

Jian, Guowei ,10.1177/0093650211432468,"Although earlier research on leader-member exchange (LMX) theory supported a negative linear relationship between LMX quality and role stressors, recent studies suggest that a more complex, nonlinear relationship may exist between LMX quality and variables traditionally associated with it. Based on communication research of LMX and social exchange theory, the aim of this article is to revisit the relationship between LMX quality and role stressors by reconceptualizing their associations and testing the hypotheses of an inverted U relationship. A survey study among immigrant employees revealed differential effects of LMX quality on role stressors. In particular, with role conflict and role overload LMX quality was found to have an inverted U relationship, but a negative linear relationship with role ambiguity. These findings challenge the prevailing assumptions and carry significant theoretical and practical implications.","| Cleveland State Univ, Sch Commun, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA (1)",Revisiting the Association of LMX Quality With Perceived Role Stressors: Evidence for Inverted U Relationships Among Immigrant Employees,"Jian, Guowei (1)","leader-member exchange,LMX,leadership communication,leadership,stress,stressor,role",14-Feb,2014,COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,WOS:000329366700003,TRUE,964,,5.84,0.63,91.5,0,1.4,0.63,"Cleveland State Univ, Sch Commun, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA",API,,1
Jian, Guowei ,10.1177/0093650214565924,"Although research has made significant gains in understanding the constitutive nature of conversation in the process of organizing, its predictive effects on organizational outcomes are still uncertain. To contribute in this direction, based on social exchange theory and leader-member exchange (LMX) research, this study examined the predictive effects of leader-member conversational quality (LMCQ) on employee organizational commitment (OC), and the potential interaction effects of LMCQ with LMX quality. Using data from an online survey, this study found that above and beyond communication frequency and other control variables, LMCQ is significantly associated with employee OC. More interestingly, the effects of LMCQ vary based on the level of LMX quality. These findings have significant implications at both theoretical and practical levels.","| Cleveland State Univ, Sch Commun, 2121 Euclid Ave,MU247, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA (1) | Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Commun, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA (2)",Conversation at Work: The Effects of Leader-Member Conversational Quality,"Jian, Guowei (1)| Dalisay, Francis (2)","leadership,leader-member exchange,supervisor-subordinate communication,conversation,organizational commitment",17-Mar,2017,COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,WOS:000394950400002,TRUE,991,,5.84,0.63,91.5,0,1.4,0.63,"Cleveland State Univ, Sch Commun, 2121 Euclid Ave,MU247, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA",API,,1
Jian, Guowei ,10.1177/0093650206289149,"Work organizations increasingly adopt shared electronic databases. However, employees' unwillingness to contribute to shared resources undermines the utility of such technologies. Current research is limited to either a utilitarian or normative perspective. To advance understanding in this area, this study proposes a three-dimensional framework. It includes the utilitarian and non-native perspectives as two complementary dimensions in addition to a third collaborative dimension. Based on this framework, the study identifies three key organizational processes and advances an additive model to predict employees' willingness to contribute to shared electronic databases. An empirical test was conducted to assess the model in a large manufacturing organization. The test showed both significant overall effects of the model and significant main effects of each predictor variable. The article will discuss the findings and address both theoretical and practical implications.","| Cleveland State Univ, Sch Commun, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA (1)",Understanding employees' willingness to contribute to shared electronic databases - A three-dimensional framework,"Jian, Guowei (1)| Jeffres, Leo W.
