Sinanan, Jolynna ,10.1177/2056305117719627,"Despite scholarly and popular assertions that social media transforms the possibilities for political engagement, there is little investigation to the relationship between public life and political discussion on social media platforms in the everyday lives of people in different cultural contexts. Based on 15 months ethnographic inquiry in a Trinidadian town, this article examines a political event (the hunger strike of Dr Wayne Kublalsingh) as it unfolded and how those not directly involved with the issue or activism more generally engaged with the protest on Facebook. We find that confrontational political opinion and commentary risks unfavorable kinds of attention: the judgment of others and being the subject of gossip and scandal. We conclude that political engagement over social media needs to be better understood within public life and the cultural specificities of a given context.","| RMIT Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic, Australia (1) | RMIT Univ, Digital Ethnog Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia (2) | Univ West Indies, Inst Gender & Dev Studies, St Augustine Campus, St Augustine, Trinid & Tobago (3)",Non-Activism: Political Engagement and Facebook Through Ethnography in Trinidad,"Sinanan, Jolynna (1)| Hosein, Gabrielle Jamela (2)","Internet politics,social media politics,social media activism,non-activism,ethnography,Trinidad,Caribbean",JUL-SEP 2017,2017,SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY,WOS:000443461800005,TRUE,222,,0,42.82,24.23,0,16.06,9.86,"RMIT Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,,1

The first regards disintermediation as a basis for direct democracy, transcending the traditional arrangements and institutions of political representation. The second model institutionalizes digital information and communication technology (ICT) within the rational-bureacratic framework of existing governance. The third model is based upon a reconceptualization of democratic representation, based upon new notions of accountability, plurality and authentic reality.

The methodology combines the technique of in-depth interviews and qualitative analysis of reports, working papers and file data about 15M. The findings show an intensive use of digital technology by activists, both of their own social networks (for example, N-1) and commercial ones (Facebook or Twitter). These digital tools enabled them to disseminate their own information and optimize their internal organization. The indignados established an interplay between online activism and offline actions. Digital technology facilitated the organization of the mass gatherings in the streets. The possession of communicative and technical skills played an important part in organizing 15M. On the other hand, the relationship between journalists and activists was a difficult one. The indignados did not follow the established patterns of the journalists' work routines. The latter had to resort to the demonstrators' websites and social networks to obtain information.

The ensuing analysis of the March 1999 programmes demonstrates that, despite the different aims, agendas, target audience and ownership of the two Aquitaine-based channels, the dominant form of regionalism is based upon a sense of opposition to unsympathetic and overly centralized national and European policy. This 'oppositional regionalism', stronger in the state-owned FR3 Aquitaine regional news than in the privately owned M6 Bordeaux local bulletins, supersedes even 'neo-regionalism', which is based upon a sense of a shared economic future.","| Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England (1)",Local specificity and regional unity under siege: territorial identity and the television news of Aquitaine,"Scriven, M (1)| Roberts, E (2)",,1-Sep,2001,MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY,WOS:000173323100003,TRUE,2207,,49.29,45.7,0.52,0.47,2.13,1.89,"Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",,,1

As on-site researchers, we were asked to design and deploy digital tools to support the organization in exchange for conducting research on organizational uses of technology. This work draws from our time with the group to ask: how might community-based researchers revisit and realign our research methods to better respond to the changing needs and practices of a research site? Our observations identified three recurring technological concerns expressed by staff that pointed to competing agendas and needs within the organization, specifically across different levels of scale: operational, proximal, and temporal. We then discuss these patterns around broader organizational concerns to reflect on how they impacted our own research methods and commitments.

The study utilized a 17 item list of potential disclosure items (name, email address, etc.), categorized reliably into six sub-indices: contact information, payment information, life history information, financial/medical information, work-related information, and online account information. Online disclosure consciousness (ODC) is introduced as a framework to conceptualize, explain the study's findings, and empirically measure the gap between one's willingness to disclose and perceived risk pertaining to the overall 17-item index used in the study, the sub-indices, and particular items. The results show significant gaps among participants both within and across nations. Despite Estonia's advanced adoption and progressive policies and practices toward the Internet, Americans are more willing to disclose, and less concerned about perceived risks. The findings suggest willingness to disclose and risk aversion can and should be analyzed empirically together.

We devote particular attention to the issue of whether Internet use is associated with more or less diverse or 'liberal' political opinions and to how these associations have changed since 2000. In general, we found that where differences existed, they were in the direction of Internet users being more supportive of diverse and tolerant points of view than were non-users, consistent with the premise that going online is a way of expressing openness to opposing points of view and new experiences. However, the differences were often non-monotonic - that is, openness did not always increase progressively with the amount of Internet use. Moreover, there were differences for some racial/family/sexual/political attitudes but not others, in patterns that do not fit easily under standard labels such as liberal, conservative or even libertarian. Internet users also expressed slightly more optimistic and sociable attitudes on certain other GSS questions. On most GSS items, however, either there were no differences between Internet users and non-users, or the differences could be explained by age, education, race, gender or income factors. Thus, respondents in Internet surveys can be expected to differ from non-Internet respondents in being selectively more tolerant on certain political issues, but not on most other political issues.

Robinson, Laura ,10.1080/1369118X.2013.770049,"Based on original data from one-on-one and focus group interviews with high school students in California, this article reveals how consistent access to or deprivation from informational resources influences information synthesis for scholastic work. In order to hold motivation constant, the article delineates three kinds of Striver students: Endowed, Entrepreneurial, and Empowered. The article examines the ways in which Strivers obtain information relevant to schoolwork from digital media, non-digital media, and knowledgeable individuals. Findings reveal linkages between access to informational resources and the internalization of a self-reliant or other-reliant stance towards information synthesis. Endowed-Strivers who enjoy synergistic access to informational resources adopt a self-reliant information habitus. By contrast, Entrepreneurial-Strivers with few home resources engage in linear strategies that facilitate an other-reliant information habitus. The third group, the Empowered-Strivers, benefits from school-based interventions that give them multiple information channels. Such IT interventions can act as substitutes for the rich informational resources enjoyed by Endowed-Strivers at home. Access to IT resources and teacher modeling at school make it possible for Empowered-Strivers to develop a self-reliant information habitus with regard to schoolwork. In showing how a favorable school-based information opportunity structure can compensate for inadequate informational resources at home, the analysis reveals the ways in which informational inequality is both created and sometimes overcome. By illuminating the relationships between access conditions, information opportunity structures, and types of information habitus, the article shows how synergistic use of informational resources plays a critical role in larger digital inequalities.","| Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA (1)","Endowed, Entrepreneurial, and Empowered-Strivers: Doing a lot with a lot, doing a lot with a little","Robinson, Laura (1)","information capital,Bourdieu,information habitus,digital inequality,striver,habitus",MAY 28 2014,2014,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,WOS:000333873900001,TRUE,382,,48.7,44.93,0.46,0.53,2.77,2.61,"Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",,,1

Analyzing primary survey and interview data, findings reveal the roles played by spatial-temporal constraints and emotional costs in creating disparities in usage and skills among differently situated respondents. A close examination of the interview material discloses a dramatic divergence in the informational orientation or habitus internalized by respondents with more-and less-constrained internet access. Drawing on Bourdieu's concept of skhole', the work outlines the differences between the playful or exploratory stance adopted by those with high-quality internet access and the task-oriented stance assumed by those with low-quality internet access. Analysis reveals that those with low-autonomy, low-quality access enact a 'taste for the necessary' in their rationing of internet use to avoid what they perceive as 'wasteful' activities with no immediate payoff. The article closes with an eye to developing a theory of information habitus, a potentially invaluable concept in future research on digital inequality.","| Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA (1)",A TASTE FOR THE NECESSARY A Bourdieuian approach to digital inequality,"Robinson, Laura (1)","digital inequality,information habitus,skhole,web searches,web surfing,time",2009,2009,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,WOS:000207871100003,TRUE,525,,48.7,44.93,0.46,0.53,2.77,2.61,"Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",,,1

The article explores intra-familial bargaining over time spent on the internet. Analysis pays special attention to families that prioritize capital-enhancing activities such as schoolwork and college applications. In these families, access to resources is guided by implicit social contracts between parents and children, as well as between siblings. The findings illuminate how these social contracts imply particular rights and responsibilities depending on the families' level of wiredness: highly wired, partially wired, and unwired families. Comparing the experiences of students from these three groups reveals that members of each kind of family experience a different form of net time. While youths from highly wired families enjoy individualized net time, members of partially wired families divvy up household net time. The most disadvantaged youth come from unwired families in which family members must make sacrifices for youth to obtain net time outside of the household. The examination illuminates the logics that underpin the familial negotiations over each kind of net time. Ultimately, familial social contracts over net time have the power to encourage or hinder use of net time for capital-enhancing activities.","| Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA (1) | Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA (2)",NET TIME NEGOTIATIONS WITHIN THE FAMILY,"Robinson, Laura (1)| Schulz, Jeremy (2)","computer-mediated communication,digital divide,family,domestication of ICTs,young people,information habitus,net time,digital inclusion",MAY 1 2013,2013,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,WOS:000317761100006,TRUE,912,,48.7,44.93,0.46,0.53,2.77,2.61,"Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",,,1

The analysis reveals how unequal access to digital resources shapes how well youths are able to play what I call the identity curation game. Digital resources determine youths' ability to succeed in this game that is governed by three implicit rules: (1) constantly update or be sidelined, (2) engage in constant reciprocated identity-affirming interactions, and (3) maintain a strategy of vigilance to remove traces of failed identity performances. This article draws on Symbolic Interactionism and pays particular attention to Hochschild's theory of emotion management. Drawing on these frameworks, the findings reveal how under-resourced youths experience connectivity gaps that disrupt their ability to play the identity curation game, as well as the resulting emotional consequences. Under-resourced youths manage distinctive negative emotions arising from connectivity gaps that hinder their digital identity work, as well as engaging in distinct kinds of suppressive work to police their own emotions including longing, envy, shame, frustration, and stigmatization. In making these linkages, the research reveals the cascading effects of digital inequality among youths where constant connectivity is the sine qua non of social inclusion.","| Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA (1)","The identity curation game: digital inequality, identity work, and emotion management","Robinson, Laura (1)","Digital divide,digital inequality,young people,identity,symbolic,interaction,emotion work",2018,2018,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,WOS:000425398800003,TRUE,976,,48.7,44.93,0.46,0.53,2.77,2.61,"Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",,,1
Robinson, John P. ,10.1080/1369118X.2011.562223,"A major concern about new technologies like information technology (IT) is how much they impact existing media and behaviour, particularly in reducing time on these behaviours.

It uses data from three separate national surveys about the public's leisure participation: (1) estimate data from the SPPA2008; (2) single-day diary data from the 2003-2007 American Time Use Survey; and (3) weekly diary data from the 2000 National Survey of Parents to examine whether users of IT participate less in various leisure activities, perhaps as a function of substituting IT use for participating more actively. First, the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA) estimate data show that users and heavier IT users are also more active in a variety of other free time activities such as movies, volunteering and sports. Moreover, the relation continues to hold after education (the major predictor of leisure participation), income, age and other predictors of leisure activity are controlled. However, both daily and weekly diary data show far less if any difference, and the lack of parallel results from these diary studies raises questions about whether the SPPA correlations result from a 'response set' of respondents overestimating their activity participation. Nonetheless, there still seems no solid evidence that IT leads to notable decreases in social life, media use or other ways of spending both free time and non-leisure time, as claimed in three initial surveys.","| Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA (1)",IT USE AND LEISURE TIME DISPLACEMENT Convergent evidence over the last 15 years,"Robinson, John P.

Although recipients benefit from social support, there are also potential benefits to the providers of social support that have gone relatively unexplored. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship between the reception and provision of informational social support by cancer patients. Based on the work of Gouldner (1960), this investigation attempts to examine the role reciprocity plays within the social support process. The norm of reciprocity is conceptualized as a generalized moral belief rather than as a simple pattern of exchange between caregivers and care receivers. Use of reciprocity as a generalized moral belief instead of a pattern of behavioral exchange between providers and recipients of social support allows a more thorough integration theoretically and more methodical examination of the role the relationship between providers and recipients plays in this process. Specifically, this investigation employs the notion of optimal matching as part of the mechanism underlying the satisfactions derived from informational social support. The results of the logistic regression analyses suggest that reciprocity is a viable explanation of the mechanism underlying the desire to provide social support to others among cancer patients and among adults who have never been diagnosed with cancer. This relationship between the reception and the provision of informational social support remains even after controlling for age, education, gender, race, social integration, and cancer diagnosis.

To better understand reactions to weight-centric health messages, college-aged women evaluated the Bryn Mawr College e-mail. Using an embedded mixed-methods design, analysis revealed that reactions followed four positive themes, six negative themes, and one neutral theme.

Robinson, JD ,,"Although cancer occurs throughout the life span, many of the most frequently occurring types of cancer increase as we grow older. In fact, only cardiovascular disease accounts for more deaths in adults 65 years of age and older. One of the ways that cancer patients cope or adapt to their illness is through socially supportive communicative interactions and relationships. Cutrona and, Russell (1990) argued that social support is multidimensional and suggested that social support is most effective when the support needs of the individual are consistent with the type of social support being offered by the support provider. From the communicative perspective, the notion of optimal matching between the types of social support desired and the type of social support offered is extended to include the type of relationship between the communicants. In addition, it is argued that computer-mediated social support can be superior to face-to-face social support.

Unmet concerns have potentially negative consequences for patients' health, and may pose utilization-based financial burdens to health care systems if patients return to deal with such concerns. One solution to the problem of unmet concerns is the communication skill known as up-front agenda setting, where physicians (after soliciting patients' chief concerns) continue to solicit patients' concerns to exhaustion with questions such as Are there some other issues you'd like to address? Although this skill is trainable and efficacious, it is not yet a panacea. This article uses conversation analysis to demonstrate that patients understand up-front agenda-setting questions in ways that hamper their effectiveness. Specifically, we demonstrate that up-front agenda-setting questions are understood as making relevant new problems (i.e., concerns that are either totally new or new since last visit, and in need of diagnosis), and consequently bias answers away from non-new problems (i.e., issues related to previously diagnosed concerns, including much of chronic care).

Comparing advantaged and disadvantaged students' practices, the research illuminates three phases of their information-seeking activities: 1) learning-opportunities for digital skill building, 2) information-retrieval tactics, and 3) information-evaluation strategies. The inquiry delineates several distinct categories of practice corresponding to each of these phases. In successful information-seeking, learning-opportunities enhance skill acquisition for effective information-retrieval that is followed by discerning information-evaluation. In unsuccessful information-seeking, inadequate learning-opportunities result in ineffective information-retrieval that is followed by disengaged information-nonevaluation. Significantly, gendered differences emerge in this final part of the sequence. Findings indicate that unskilled female information-searchers are more likely to adopt an overtrusting stance. By contrast, unskilled male information-searchers are more likely to adopt an undertrusting attitude towards online content. Both groups of unsuccessful information-searchers truncate this necessary evaluative stage and end the information-seeking process before it can bear fruit.","| Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA (1)","Freeways, detours, and dead ends: Search journeys among disadvantaged youth","Robinson, Laura (1)","information-searching,youth/young people,gender,information-retrieval,Digital inequality,information-seeking,information-evaluation,learning",14-Mar,2014,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,WOS:000331464000004,TRUE,204,,48.7,44.93,0.46,0.53,2.77,2.61,"Santa Clara Univ, Dept Sociol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",,,1

Robinson,Sue,10.1080/1461670X.2013.824207,"This research documented the collective mnemonic story that arose from the news coverage of the first anniversary of the Wisconsin protests in 2012. The evidence from news articles, books, and social media demonstrated that although interactivity offered an opportunity for people to reclaim the story of the protests, the content in citizen-populated spaces only served to recreate the fiery binaries from the mainstream news coverage. Strategic rituals of objectivity dominated reportorial writing; citizens used eyewitness reports, personal experience, and links to assert their right to remember. In the end, the stories that emerged were so divisive-even at the anniversary-that no collective memory appeared to be coalescing and the state remained mired in its past. This case study serves as an opportunity to unveil the processes of collective memory formation in a digital era when citizens can help produce the nation's historical accountings alongside journalists. This evidence demonstrated that user-generated spaces online can disrupt formalized collective-memory formation and become a place where time stands still, raw feelings can fester, and little in the way of alternative perspective prevails, despite new-media scholars' hopes.","| Univ Wisconsin, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA (1)","""A NEWS NEGOTIATION OF A STATE'S """"HISTORY'' Collective memory of the 2011 Wisconsin protests""","obinson, Sue (1)| Knisely, Sandra (2)| Schwartz, Mitchael L.

The system tracks patient-HCP interaction, and in total 924 personal messages were exchanged. These 924 messages contained 6,411 message units that were content analyzed using a nine-category scheme. Patient blood glucose monitoring was found to be related to the frequency of phatic communication, informational social support, and tangible social support messages, as well as messages containing references to personal contact.

First-year residents (n=7) at a large private East Coast university hospital had an interaction with a patient recorded and posted to a training blog. The residents then watched this, and posted a reaction to their interaction with the patient. Within this reaction the residents offered self-reflection on the experience and were provided an opportunity to solicit advice from their colleagues to improve their communicative strategies and style. Once the reaction was posted to the blog, other residents watched the videotaped interaction, read the self-assessment written by the resident, and responded as part of their communication training. Content analysis of the messages suggests that the residents are socially skilled. They offer each other advice, provide each other with emotional and esteem social support, and use techniques such as self-deprecation in what appears to be a strategic manner. Perhaps most interesting is that they tend to identify the problems and difficulties they experience during patient-physician interactions in an apparent effort to deflect responsibility from the practicing physician.

Perceptions about learning about diabetes from reading the digital messages sent by their HCP also predicted improved patient health.

Findings suggest that the public nature of Linkedin resume claims affected the kinds of deception used to create positive impressions, but did not affect the overall frequency of deception. Compared with traditional resumes, Linkedin resumes were less deceptive about the kinds of information that count most to employers, namely an applicant's prior work experience and responsibilities, but more deceptive about interests and hobbies. The results stand in contrast to assumptions that Internet-based communication is more deceptive than traditional formats, and suggests that a framework that considers deception as a resource for self-presentation can account for the findings.","| Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA (1) | Cornell Univ, Dept Informat Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA (2)",The Effect of Linkedin on Deception in Resumes,"Guillory, Jamie (1)| Hancock, Jeffrey T.

The study also explores whether teens' short-term coping responses serve to mitigate PTSD or, instead, act as a response to stress from online events."""", 'Design/methodology/approach The study utilized a web-based diary design over the course of two months. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling with repeated measures.', 'Findings The study confirmed that explicit content exposure, cyberbullying and sexual solicitations (but not information breaches) evoke symptoms of PTSD. Analyses also indicated that teens engage in active and communicative coping after they experience post-traumatic stress, regardless of risk type or frequency.', 'Practical implications The authors found that teens took active measures to cope with online risks soon after they felt threatened (within a week). Actively coping with stressful situations has been shown to enhance adolescent resilience and reduce long-term negative effects of risk exposure. If these early coping behaviors can be detected, social media platforms may be able to embed effective interventions to support healthy coping processes that can further protect teens against long-term harm from exposure to online risks.', 'Originality/value This is the first study to examine situational PTSD symptoms related to four types of adolescent online risk exposure within the week exposure occurred. By applying two competing theoretical frameworks (the adolescent resilience framework and transactional theory of stress), the authors show empirical evidence that suggests short-term coping responses are likely a stress reaction to PTSD, not a protective factor against it.']""","| Univ Cent Florida, Dept Psychol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA (1) | Univ Cent Florida, Dept Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA (2) | Penn State Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA (3)","When social media traumatizes teens: The roles of online risk exposure, coping, and post-traumatic stress","Hugh, Bridget Christine (1)| Wisniewski, Pamela (2)| Rosson, Mary Beth (3)| Carroll, John M.

Local television news channels devoted much of their airtime to the four-month-long spectacle, showcasing how the effects of an independent media still negotiating the boundaries drawn by an authoritative military shapes the ways in which mediated populism can manifest itself. In analyzing the media discourse surrounding the protest, this article focuses on how the Pakistani liberal narrative on the transformation of the political mediascape turns most anxiously on the specter of populist politics, particularly on the illiberal nature of such figurations.

Hagins, J ,,"The emerging information infrastructure presents a number of complex challenges to policymakers. Current information policy-as exppressed in the Clinton-Gore Agenda for Action report and most recently on the Senate floor-promotes private sector development of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). With current policy discourse revolving around issues of deregulation, unregulation and free-market development, there is cause to question whether a market-driven infrastructure will be responsive to public interest concerns. A lack of responsiveness could serve to widen existing gaps between the information-rich and information-poor. If the primary uses of the NII are communication-seeking rather than information-seeking, as many observers have noted, then a lack of critical mass could well undermine the overall utility of the infrastructure. An alternative policy approach is presented in which development focuses on the least-abled rather than most-abled users.

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit.

Williams, A ,,"This paper reports and discusses a study undertaken at a West Coast U.S. retirement community. Fifteen able elderly residents were interviewed about their personal relationships and communication with peers, family, and younger people. The paper examines how the residents' discourse reveals a number of dialectical contradictions that elders who choose the retirement community lifestyle may need to manage in order to facilitate adjustment. Among the dialectical contradictions discussed here is the difficulty of managing issues of autonomy versus connection with the family network on the one hand land the retirement community on the other. This is a particularly salient issue, given the dominance of dependency-related stereotypes associated with such communities and those who choose to reside in them. This paper also looks at the contradictory dialectical pushes and pulls of connection and autonomy with respect to peer and friendship networks within the community. In this regard, our data illustrate residents' attempts to manage stresses that ill health and frailty place on relationships. In some senses, the elders interviewed especially frail elders, positively disassociated themselves from some peers, while seeking to form and maintain satisfactory relationships with other peers, some of whom were in ill health.

Challengers and candidates for open seats were more likely to be early adopters, but incumbents used Facebook more extensively.

We also conducted interviews with eight providers (physicians and nurses) after the intervention to get their feedback on its implementation.

Weatherall, A ,,"Empirical and theoretical research on gender and language has demonstrated how issues of power and identity are communicated by the way in which women and men are referred to in language. To broaden and update past work on sex bias in language, the present study investigated references to men and women in prompted but impromptu discussions of a popular television program. The content of the descriptions was examined for evidence of sex bias. There was some indication that the form and content of descriptions varied depending on the sex of the referent. However, the language used was not as overtly or pervasively sexist as had been expected. It is suggested that an important task is to document how linguistic bias is routinized or legitimated in different conversational contexts. In that way, language use can lead to a better understanding of the creation and maintenance of power hierarchies in social groups.","| Victoria Univ Wellington, Dept Psychol, Wellington, New Zealand (1)",Women and men in language - An analysis of seminaturalistic person descriptions,"Weatherall, A (1)",,Dec-98,1998,HUMAN COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,WOS:000076936600006,TRUE,252,,45.01,49.37,0,0,3.01,1.66,"Victoria Univ Wellington, Dept Psychol, Wellington, New Zealand",,,1

Compared to print media and radio, which are decentralized, Indonesia's television industry is dominated by five large media corporations that are all based in the capital city of Jakarta. As a consequence, this fails to leave much growing space to television stations at a local level, which would be needed to strengthen Indonesia's democratization. Media owners have successfully influenced the government in establishing a set of policies that sustain their dominance of the industry. Players within the television industry have even successfully swayed the direction of the broadcasting decentralization mandated by the Broadcasting Bill during Indonesia's early political Reform period. The influence of these 'Jakarta television stations' stunted the development of television stations outside of Jakarta. Not only it deprives local actors of the economic value of developing their own television industry would bring, it also has resulted in the the loss of television's potential in functioning as a public sphere facilitating social control over democratic processes.

Building upon poststructuralist theorizations of power, I demonstrate that rather than operating through restriction, rules construct the possibility of the game, producing the game world and norms of play practice.

Social media impose precise material constraints on their social affordances, which have profound implications in both the symbolic production and organizational dynamics of social action. The materiality of social media deeply affects identity building, in two ways: firstly, it amplifies the interactive and shared' elements of collective identity (Melucci, 1996), and secondly, it sets in motion a politics of visibility characterized by individuality, performance, visibility, and juxtaposition. The politics of visibility, at the heart of what I call cloud protesting', exacerbates the centrality of the subjective and private experience of the individual in contemporary mobilizations, and has partially replaced the politics of identity typical of social movements.

Study 2 found that ERT message characteristics influenced the perceived unreasonableness of the task for employees in high-quality relationships, suggesting employees in such relationships are particularly vulnerable to """"job creep"""" and role expansion.""","| Univ Arizona, Dept Commun, 1103 E Univ Blvd,POB 210025, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA (1)","""""""I know it's not your job but ..."""": Extra-role tasks, communication, and leader-member exchange relationships""","Sias, Patricia M.

The results indicated that strategy use likelihood scores varied little as a function of the hierarchical level of the target. Likelihood of strategy use scores did vary by deterioration event; however, that accounted for little variance in strategy scores.

We collect the data for the choice experiment through a face-to-face survey held in all districts of North Cyprus. The results indicate that people value unrestrained roaming services the most.

In this article we explore how reenactments are deployed in the course of, and indeed support work in, collaborative data analysis sessions among groups of social scientists (and primarily conversation analysts). The data used to build the analysis are drawn from audiovisual recordings of a range of data sessions involving formal and informal groupings of social scientists who themselves are analyzing video data. One way in which participants discuss and discriminate on-screen conduct is through imitating or enacting that conduct. This article examines how participants, having noticed something on-screen, set about having others see it (or see it in a particular way) through the use of reenactments, which are not a reproduction of the actions on-screen but a version of events that inevitably selects and often exaggerates certain features. In doing so we highlight some of the key differences in the design of reenactments in these data sessions, in comparison to those that feature in everyday conversational settings. These differences concern the relationship of the design of the reenactments to visible artifacts in the scene, the configuration of the interactional huddle, and the opportunities for coparticipants to progressively shape and reshape the reenactment.

Findings reveal a shift in the iconography of SI from direct depictions of self-injured bodies to re-appropriations of popular media content that figuratively represent emotional struggles. Images of self-inflicted wounds received 10 times less reblogs than images without wounds, and media memes conveying hopeless moods were the most widely distributed.

Despite the growing evidence in physical health and adult mental health, however, little information is available about how mobile phones are implemented to deliver mental health services to the younger population. The purpose of this scoping study was to map the current state of knowledge regarding mobile mental health (mMental Health) for young people (age 13-24 years), identify gaps, and consider implications for future research. Seventeen articles that met the inclusion criteria provided evidence for mobile phones as a way to engage youth in therapeutic activities. The flexibility, interactivity, and spontaneous nature of mobile communications were also considered advantageous in encouraging persistent and continual access to care outside clinical settings. Four gaps in current knowledge were identified: the scarcity of studies conducted in low and middle income countries, the absence of information about the real-life feasibility of mobile tools, the need to address the issue of technical and health literacy of both young users and health professionals, and the need for critical discussion regarding diverse ethical issues associated with mobile phone use. We suggest that mMental Health researchers and clinicians should carefully consider the ethical issues related to patient-practitioner relationship, best practices, and the logic of self-surveillance.","| Univ Guelph, Self Injury & E Mental Hlth Lab, Dept Psychol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada (1) | CAMH, Toronto, ON M6J1H1, Canada (2) | CAMH, Social Aetiol Mental Illness SAMI Training Progra, Toronto, ON M6J1H1, Canada (3)",Youth Mental Health Interventions via Mobile Phones: A Scoping Review,"ko, Yukari (1)| Kidd, Sean (2)| Wiljer, David (3)| McKenzie, Kwame (4)",,14-Sep,2014,CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,WOS:000341827000005,FALSE,815,corrected,42.86,3.9,42.86,0,6.49,3.9,"Univ Guelph, Self Injury & E Mental Hlth Lab, Dept Psychol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",,,1

Both therefore centre on style as the expression of identity and values. The authors use this approach to understand the language of a global women's magazine, Cosmopolitan. Cosmopolitan style is a hybrid of different styles, chosen for the connotations they bring, for the way they help express the magazine's identity and values.

This is because it excludes a range of actions like satire and humour which have come to play an increasing role in inspiring and provoking powerful political emotions and in informing the political agenda. Drawing on the work of critical scholars, it is argued that emotion, ethics and art can be deeply political. Moreover, new forms of media have encouraged new-old forms of political action often at the hands of young people who hitherto have been marginalized from the public sphere. Digital technology enables the production of user-generated content, opening new spaces for information, the exchange of ideas and mobilization. This article highlights the work of the young German satirist Jan Bohmermann to demonstrate how expressive art is playing a major role in shaping public opinion, in contesting power elites and informing political debate.

Critical events are contextually dramatic happenings, such as economic depressions, environmental disasters, intense physical confrontations, strategic initiatives by a social movement organization, or new public policies.  A critical event focuses public attention, which is itself a scarce resource in the claims-making process.  It invites the collective definition or redefinition of a social problem when movement activists, media operatives, and others compete over the meaning assigned to the issues evoked.  A redefining critical event occurs when the perception of reality surrounding movement issues shifts markedly among elites and mass publics.  In a case in Nashville, TN, for example, a tax-increase referendum became a redefining event when conservative movement operatives successfully shifted ''the problem'' of the schools from issues of distributive justice to issues of efficient production.

Second, unlike other endist talk (the end of art or history, etc.), privacy endism appears ongoing and not period specific. Finally, our explanation of the persistence and idiosyncrasy of claims to the end of privacy focuses on Warren and Brandeis's 1890 negative conception of privacy as 'the right to be let alone': namely, modern privacy talk has always been endist because the right to privacy was born out of the conditions for its violation, not its realization.

A distanced, neutral and reflexive style of the quality press contrasts with the construction of a sensationalistic narrative by the popular press. The latter provided the audience with a daily dose of vicarious participation in a criminal drama which developed into a trial by media, sustained by a rhetoric that encourages the audience to 'take sides'.

We find a number of PR professionals who understand news in depth, and whose media relations practice goes beyond the classic information subsidy, to what we call an editorial subsidy: targeted, tailored, page-ready news copy that contains key client messages. PR practitioners see power relationships in complex and contradictory ways, though. Despite many circumstances working in their favour, this does not mean they necessary feel emboldened in their everyday encounters with journalists.

This article examines the attitudes that, taken collectively within a region, may contribute to a climate that is conducive to and supportive of this activity.  Four different components that characterize these attitudes are identified-the willingness to take risks and accept the possibility of failure, the perceived difficulty of starting new firms, the importance and respect accorded to new and small firms and their owners, and the socialization children are likely to receive from their parents.  These attitudinal components are related to measures of the structure and performance of the respondent's local economy and to individual factors.  The most important finding is that pro-entrepreneurial attitudes are lower among individuals working in large organizations and among those who live in areas dominated by large organizations regardless of the size of their own employer.  Other measures of the local economy, such as past success in creating new businesses, were not associated with differences in attitudes.

The study therefore examines this in detail by testing a number of individual characteristics for their moderating effects. The author found that relative to issue-based coverage, strategic news frames increased issue-specific political cynicism, but this effect was only evident for those who were less politically engaged and knowledgeable. The effects of the strategy frame on more global measures of political cynicism were minimal.

In particular, the accidental leakage or deliberate harvesting of information, via either hacking or social engineering, is an omnipresent threat to a large number of commercial organisations and state agencies who manage digital databases and sociotechnical forms of data. Throughout the twenty-first century the global media have reported on a series of data breaches, fuelling anxiety among the public concerning the safety and security of their personal and financial data.

Banks, Patricia A. ,10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.004,"""In the West and Africa alike auctions dedicated to contemporary African art have become increasingly common. Along with other developments, these specialized sales are cited in claims of a boom for contemporary African art. However, there is a dearth of empirical research on long-term changes in the incorporation of African born artists in """"mainstream"""" contemporary sales at Western auction houses. Given that these sales bring together art from across geographic lines, they are an important indicator for measuring the degree to which the market for this work has internationalized. This paper helps to fill this gap in knowledge by presenting the first complete history of African born artists in the main contemporary sales at Christie's. It draws on an original archive of all artworks consigned at Christie's New York May and November contemporary day and evening sales from their inception in the 1970s until 2015. Findings show that there has been a slight rise, but not a boom, in the consignment of works by African born artists in the post-1989 era. I speculate that the small increases are related to directed efforts to legitimate contemporary African art as well as other shifts in the symbolic valuation of contemporary art. This paper advances scholarship on the internationalization of the art market by offering new empirical insights on the cultural hybridization of contemporary auctions in the West. More specifically, while the increases support arguments that contemporary African art is globalizing, the small rates of participation across time lend credence to critiques that claims of a highly internationalized art world are overstated.

Longitudinal analysis showed that enhanced anthropomorphism had no significant impact on any PAX dimension immediately or over time, when controlling for demographic and gameplay variables.

Campus,Donatella,10.1080/10584600802427039,"This article analyzes the role of interpersonal discussion networks and television as the key mediators of political information that can potentially drive citizens' electoral choices. The research relies on survey data of Italian voters in the aftermath of the 2006 general election. Findings show that the partisan intensity of discussion networks significantly affects the vote, so that citizens embedded in homogeneous partisan networks are more influenced than those who discuss politics within heterogeneous networks that do not uniformly support a unified political position. The effects of television news programs and talk shows turn out to be comparatively smaller than those of interpersonal networks, but are still significant for those programs and formats that attract politically diverse audiences. We interpret this result as a consequence of the increasing relevance of selective exposure in the Italian electorate, which has largely been documented by previous research. Thus, while the effects of interpersonal discussion networks seem to depend on the degree of their partisan intensity, the impact of television seems to be enhanced, in the Italian context, by a program's ability to present itself as less openly biased than most of the competitors, thus failing to elicit selective exposure by viewers. The main implication of this study is that interpersonal communication has a remarkable influence on citizens' choices, and it should be studied together with mass communication, as they both constitute crucial components of voters' information environments, although their effects depend on partially different factors.","| Univ Bologna, Dept Polit Sci, I-40125 Bologna, Italy (1)","Social Networks, Political Discussion, and Voting in Italy: A Study of the 2006 Election","ampus, Donatella (1)| Pasquino, Gianfranco (2)| Vaccari, Cristian (3)","political discussion,interpersonal communication,mass media effects,Italian politics",2008,2008,POLITICAL COMMUNICATION,WOS:000261190400005,FALSE,576,corrected,38.55,3.35,1.96,7.26,3.63,45.25,"Univ Bologna, Dept Polit Sci, I-40125 Bologna, Italy",,,1

With the rapidity at which broadband construction projects are dotting America, it is important to understand the social impacts of these infrastructural projects. One particularly salient issue is whether access to the Internet would decrease the involvement of youth in their home communities since youth and issues of talent retention are crucial to the long-term viability of rural communities. However, findings on this topic have been a mixed bag with some studies suggesting that the use of online social networking decreases community involvement while others have found that it may maintain or even increase community involvement. This study set out to clarify the conflicting findings and in the process, it has found support for both the displacement effect as well as an augmentation effect. The dual processes suggest that merely examining time spent on social networking sites does not provide a complete picture of the effects of Internet use on community involvement. The nature of the interactions and the participants in the online social networking also play an important role. For rural community leaders working towards the long-term viability of their communities, the findings suggest that efforts should be directed towards mitigating the displacement effects of Internet use while harnessing popular Internet applications such as social networking sites to augment the involvement that youth have in their home communities.","| Michigan State Univ, Coll Comm Arts & Sci, TISM, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA (1) | Michigan State Univ, Dept Telecommun, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA (2)",THE USE OF ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING BY RURAL YOUTH AND ITS EFFECTS ON COMMUNITY ATTACHMENT,"ew, Han Ei (1)| LaRose, Robert (2)| Steinfield, Charles (3)| Velasquez, Alcides (4)","social networking,ICTs,young people,rural studies",2011,2011,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,WOS:000299819900007,FALSE,285,corrected,37.73,14.54,39.7,0.46,3.69,3.87,"Michigan State Univ, Coll Comm Arts & Sci, TISM, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA",,,1

To test this argument, I conduct two survey experiments in which participants are randomly assigned to treatments in which the substantive content and text remains the same but is packaged to mimic different media types. Generally, audio and video increase awareness of incivility cues as well as participants' evaluations of negative, emotional, and entertaining tone. There are also differences in the extent to which individuals notice incivility on Twitter than on other text-based media platforms. The social media platform is also particularly entertaining in comparison to the other platforms studied.

Numerous studies clearly link low levels of education, literacy, and health literacy with poor health, poor health care utilization, increased barriers to care, and early death. However, theoretical understandings and methods of measuring the complex social construct of health literacy have experienced a continual evolution that remains incomplete. As a result, the seemingly most-cited definition of health literacy proposed in the now-decade-old Institute of Medicine report on health literacy is long overdue for updating. Such an effort should engage a broad and diverse set of health literacy researchers, practitioners, and members of the public in creating a definition that can earn broad consensus through validation testing in a rigorous scientific approach. That effort also could produce the basis for a new universally applicable measure of health literacy. Funders, health systems, and policymakers should reconsider their timid approach to health literacy.

While the inherent promise of health literacy is improved health and well-being, the bulk of research has focused on identifying the negative effects of a lack of health literacy. This strategy is a hindrance to further identifying the utility and increasing the uptake of lessons learned about health literacy in government, business, health care systems, and society. The field needs to reverse direction away from that deficit model of health literacy and focus collective efforts on a positive model of how health literacy can and should be prioritized and utilized to improve health at lower costs. This shift from framing health literacy as a problem to proving the viability and strength of health literacy as a solution will present to policymakers a clear choice to either adopt and promote the best practices of health literacy or suffer the consequences of being the leader who ignored a proven, viable solution to the currently unsustainable health care expenditures and ever-increasing burden of preventable disease, disability, and early death.","| Canyon Ranch Inst, Tucson, AZ 85750 USA (1) | Brookings Inst, Engelberg Ctr Hlth Care Reform, Washington, DC 20036 USA (2) | Canyon Ranch Inst, Tucson, AZ 85750 USA (3)",Health Literacy Research and Practice: A Needed Paradigm Shift,"asant, Andrew (1)| Cabe, Jennifer (2)| Patel, Kavita (3)| Cosenza, Jennifer (4)| Carmona, Richard (5)",,DEC 2 2015,2015,HEALTH COMMUNICATION,WOS:000361206200006,FALSE,552,corrected,36.53,54.92,0.33,1.61,3.56,3.05,"Canyon Ranch Inst, Tucson, AZ 85750 USA",,,1

Lee, Sang Yup ,10.1016/j.tele.2015.02.007,"Homophily and social influence are the main explanations for why there are more ties among people who have similar socio-demographic or behavioral characteristics. Homophily refers to the phenomenon that people are more likely to make relational ties with others who are similar to themselves than those who are not, whereas social influence refers to the phenomenon that an individual's behavior is likely to become more similar to that of her friends over time. It is important to study both homophily and social influence processes of a social network because each process can lead to different structural characteristics for a social network; homophily can lead to separation among the members of a network, whereas social influence can lead to network-wide uniformity. In this study, we examine homophily and social influence processes among online casual game players. Specifically, we ask whether an online casual game player tends to be friends with other online casual game players who have similar game genre preferences and whether a player's genre preferences and gaming frequencies become more similar to those of her Kongregate friends over time. For this study, demographic attributes, game genre preferences, gaming frequencies, and relational ties for 2488 game players were collected for two time periods from Kongregate. The panel data were analyzed with RSiena, the R version of SIENA (Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis), a social network analysis program used for social network panel data. The results suggest that there might not be strong homophily and social influence processes operating among the game players in the sampled network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis shows that regulatory philosophy and the framework of telecommunications and broadcasting were constructed in different historical contexts in both countries.

Therefore, the study develops a model to predict on the motivation leading to consumer's intention to adopt mobile music services by extending Perceived Cost (PC), Perceived Credibility (PCr), Social Influence (SI), and Personal Innovativeness (INNO) with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). 160 Respondents were tested using a multi-stage Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. A non-linear non-compensatory Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) ANN with feed-forward back-propagation algorithm and ten cross-validation neural networks was deployed in order to capture the motivators of mobile music adoption. All predictor variables were found to have relevance to the output neuron based on the non-zero synaptic weights connected to the hidden neurons. The RMSE values indicated that the ANN models were able to predict the motivators with very high accuracy. The ANN models have out-performed the MRA models as they are able to capture the non-linear relationships between the predictor and criterion variables. While the study found that TAM is a significant predictor, the insignificance linear relationships of PCr and INNO requires further investigation.

This study asks whether exposure to such content affected young people's candidate evaluations. More important, it examines whether online satire exposure also influenced attitude toward the electoral system. It is further hypothesized that political knowledge and interpersonal discussion may facilitate processes of elaboration that allow people to develop critiques of the electoral system based on the candidate-centered satire. Analysis of a survey on university students finds that online satire exposure did relate significantly to candidate evaluation, while a positive relationship between online satire exposure and critical attitude toward the electoral system exists among respondents who discussed the election with others.

Perceptions of algorithms, regardless of the algorithms' actual performance, can significantly influence their adoption, yet we do not fully understand how people perceive decisions made by algorithms as compared with decisions made by humans. To explore perceptions of algorithmic management, we conducted an online experiment using four managerial decisions that required either mechanical or human skills. We manipulated the decision-maker (algorithmic or human), and measured perceived fairness, trust, and emotional response. With the mechanical tasks, algorithmic and human-made decisions were perceived as equally fair and trustworthy and evoked similar emotions; however, human managers' fairness and trustworthiness were attributed to the manager's authority, whereas algorithms' fairness and trustworthiness were attributed to their perceived efficiency and objectivity. Human decisions evoked some positive emotion due to the possibility of social recognition, whereas algorithmic decisions generated a more mixed response - algorithms were seen as helpful tools but also possible tracking mechanisms. With the human tasks, algorithmic decisions were perceived as less fair and trustworthy and evoked more negative emotion than human decisions. Algorithms' perceived lack of intuition and subjective judgment capabilities contributed to the lower fairness and trustworthiness judgments. Positive emotion from human decisions was attributed to social recognition, while negative emotion from algorithmic decisions was attributed to the dehumanizing experience of being evaluated by machines. This work reveals people's lay concepts of algorithmic versus human decisions in a management context and suggests that task characteristics matter in understanding people's experiences with algorithmic technologies.","| Carnegie Mellon Univ, 4615 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA (1)","Understanding perception of algorithmic decisions: Fairness, trust, and emotion in response to algorithmic management","Lee, Min Kyung (1)","Algorithmic management,perception,folk theory,fairness,trust,emotion",MAR 8 2018,2018,BIG DATA & SOCIETY,WOS:000427039300001,TRUE,26,,35.95,16.33,42.22,0.97,2.64,1.89,"Carnegie Mellon Univ, 4615 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,,1

Lee, Hye-Kyung ,10.1016/j.poetic.2008.03.002,"During the last ten years British cultural policy has seen a remarkable rise in the discourse of culture's civilising and governing powers, which are commonly called the 'social impacts' of culture. Existing analyses present two contrasting views that see this phenomenon as (a) the instrumentalisation of culture or (b) an example Of Culture's inherent governmentality. This article attempts to suggest an alternative analytical framework by pointing out historical intersections between the claims of culture's civilising function and the development of cultural field in Bourdieu's sense. For this purpose, the use of civilising claims at three moments in the British theatre history is investigated and the following is discussed. First, the claims' implementation tended to be shaped primarily by professional and artistic intentions such as the pursuit of social respectability, aesthetic excellence and autonomy. Second, as powerful rhetoric, the claims justified new institutional arrangements, which led to the establishment of the theatre as non-commercial, subsidised and exclusive high art. It is concluded that the analysis of contemporary cultural policy should consider such historical consequences of culture's civilising claims, which now set in important context where the policy is perceived and implemented.

Lee, Caroline W. ,10.1016/j.poetic.2011.05.001,"New scholarship on movements focuses on the role of art in mobilization and, relatedly, documents a shift toward a model of politics in which culture is central and constitutive. Nevertheless, researchers seldom combine the study of the changing politics of mobilization with the study of contemporary uses of art in movements. We bridge this gap by examining an attempt by performing arts service organizations to mobilize their stakeholders over the course of a four-day deliberative democratic process. Based on a multi-method study of this effort, we analyze lay actors' disagreements about the value of art and cultural change and the resultant effect of these emerging tensions on collective action efforts. We conclude that lay perceptions of the value of art in collective action may not reflect the more expansive conceptions held by contemporary activists, even when those laypersons are engaged in non-traditional forms of mobilization and are passionately devoted to the arts. As a case in which beliefs about art inhibited action, these findings reveal obstacles to the contemporary uses of art in movements.

While all minority children have lower levels of participation, we find that Asian, Hispanic, and Black children of immigrants are particularly disadvantaged even after accounting for differences in parent income and educational background. Teachers rate non-White children of immigrants lower on reading test scores even after controlling for their socioeconomic status and their test scores. Surprisingly, Asian children of immigrants fare especially badly, in contrast to often-cited academic successes for this group. Teacher evaluations of reading ability are also correlated with some forms of extracurricular activity participation, even after adjusting for children's test scores.

The findings indicate that CSR research in public relations has increased dramatically since 2006. Although theoretically grounded studies still do not represent the majority of the research in this area, the stakeholder theory is the one that is most often invoked, followed by legitimacy and attribution theories. Regarding the methodological approach, a balance between qualitative and quantitative research is evident, with a recent increase in mixed-method approaches. Content analysis was the most often used, followed by experiment, survey, comprehensive literature review, and case study. Research topics that involve CSR effects as well as descriptions of CSR practices and communication have consistently received significant attention. However, research topics that involve the role of public relations and perceptions of stakeholders have decreased in recent years.

Content analysis of their websites and sampled tweets (N=T295, C228) reveals significant differences in their emphasis on traits and issues, main content of tweet, main source of retweet, multimedia use, and the level of civility.

Findings revealed that articles addressing broad issues about the economy-in-general (economic news) that are likely to be of public concern, such as unemployment and government policies, dropped from 53 to 32 percent, while news about individual businesses, which are current or potential purchasers of newspaper advertising, rose from 17 to 30 percent. Likewise, there was significant increase in the use of corporate spokespeople used as news sources, while government and independent spokespeople decreased. An additional source analysis demonstrated that articles about individual businesses highlighted the interests of individual corporations: only 10 percent of news articles about corporations challenged the perspectives of corporations.

However, little research has been conducted on the influence of a celebrity's confession about mental illness on the public's health behaviors related to the illness. The present study examined the effects of the media coverage of celebrities with panic disorder on information-seeking, providing information about the illness, and the number of people who visited a psychiatrist in South Korea. For this, we collected all the news articles on celebrities' confessions regarding their panic disorder, search frequency of panic disorder, the number of questions on a Questions & Answers (Q&A) Website, a number of blog posts about panic disorder, and the number of people that visited a psychiatrist for panic disorder between 2010 and 2015. We found that there were positive correlations between the media's coverage of celebrities with panic disorder with other variables.

The communication management of the H1N1 pandemic, an international news event with local implications, by the Singapore government is a rich locus for understanding the dynamics of public relations, health communication, and journalism. A content analysis shows that the evolution of information from press release to news is marked by significant changes in media frames, including the expansion and diversification in dominant frames and emotion appeals, stronger thematic framing, more sources of information, conversion of loss frames into gain frames, and amplification of positive tone favoring the public health agency's position.

Second, through focus group interviews (n = 15), influences of social media use on social support were more thoroughly explored as well as their influences on general psychological disposition. Results from hierarchical regression analyses confirmed that both intensity of SNS use and online community use significantly predicted instrumental, informational, and appraisal support, while they did not predict emotional support. Further regression and Sobel tests showed that higher levels of intensity of SNS use and of online community use both led to lower levels of depression through the mediation of instrumental and informational support.

T tests showed that all 3 self-determination theory constructs - autonomy, competence, and relatedness- were higher for online health information seeking than for face-to-face office visits with physicians. A regression analysis found that 2 variables, autonomy and relatedness, explained online health information seeking. Competence was not a significant factor, likely because of competency issues faced by individuals in interpreting, understanding, and making use of online health information. The findings, which do not suggest that online health information seeking would displace physicians as many have feared, offer promise for an integrated system of care. Office visits with physicians would necessarily evolve into an expanded communicative space of health information seeking instead of an alternative channel for health information.","| Univ Colorado, Coll Media Commun & Informat, Dept Advertising Publ Relat & Media Design, Armory 102D,1511 Univ Ave,UCB 478, Boulder, CO 80309 USA (1) | Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore (2)",A Self-Determination Perspective on Online Health Information Seeking: The Internet vs. Face-to-Face Office Visits With Physicians,"Lee, Seow Ting (1)| Lin, Julian (2)",,2016,2016,JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION,WOS:000379616800012,TRUE,677,,35.95,16.33,42.22,0.97,2.64,1.89,"Univ Colorado, Coll Media Commun & Informat, Dept Advertising Publ Relat & Media Design, Armory 102D,1511 Univ Ave,UCB 478, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,,1

In particular, results show that the effects of common third-party ties and structural embeddedness exist across multiplex networks. Further, the study suggests that resource similarity of organizational dyads, resource width, and organizational centrality have positive effects on the propensity for multiplex ties.

Two findings emerged: First, this study demonstrates the third-person effect of the Internet for the first time within Western culture. Participants perceived that Internet pornography's negative effect was greater on others than themselves, and this third-person perception predicted support for Internet censorship. Second, although prior research failed to support conjecture that culture shapes third-person perception, these data show culture as an important antecedent; collectivism diminished third-person perception and subsequent support for Internet pornography censorship.

In this study, the authors focus attention on serial crowdfunders, that is, entrepreneurs who experience launching more than one crowdfunding project. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of past experience on subsequent crowdfunding performance. This study also examines whether initial success vs initial failure leads serial crowdfunders to engage in more explorative behaviors (i.e. switching industry) and to take exploitative actions (i.e. adjusting campaign strategies in terms of goal setting and funding option).

The logistic regression models are estimated to assess the impact of past entrepreneurial experience on subsequent crowdfunding decisions, and to estimate the effects of the three strategies on subsequent funding performance. Findings The results show that serial creators who experienced successful initial crowdfunding are more likely to explore a new industry or product category in the crowdfunding market and to set a higher target capital for the subsequent campaign when they change a project category.

In a Web-based experiment (n = 264), participants viewed a high profile male politician's Twitter page, wherein he was either actively responding to his followers' questions (high interactivity) or mostly posting messages on his own (low interactivity). Exposure to the high-interactivity Twitter page induced a stronger sense of direct conversation with the candidate (social presence), but only among less affiliative individuals who usually avoid social interaction. Heightened social presence, in turn, led to more positive overall evaluations of the candidate and a stronger intention to vote for him. Although those in the high-interactivity condition generated more positive thoughts, they had fewer issue-related thoughts and exhibited poorer recognition of the issues mentioned by the candidate.","| Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul 151742, South Korea (1)",Are They Talking to Me?

Drawing on the notion that people motivated by affiliation may increase their attention to sources that provide social connections, we conducted a lab experiment to explore whether priming affiliation needs would prompt the idea of online social networking. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three between-subjects conditions (affiliation arousal, social exclusion, control) in which we employed the scrambled-sentence paradigm to manipulate affiliation motivations. Each experimental condition was followed by a modified Stroop task (a color naming task) to test reaction times to SNS and non-SNS terms (including general terms and brand names). People who were primed to think about a topic typically showed slowed reaction times for naming the color of related words (i.e., Stroop interference), as those words become more interesting and accessible. Confirming our hypothesis, participants took longer to name the font color of SNS-related words than that of matched general words when affiliation motivation was evoked. Moreover, priming with affiliation motivation created more Stroop interference for SNS brand names rather than for other global brand names. These results suggest that the idea of online social networking seems to have become deeply rooted in human social practices.","| Fooyin Univ, Dept Informat Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan (1) | Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Educ, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan (2)",Keep Logging In!

Fifty-five undergraduate students were randomly assigned to two different virtual environments: high arousal contextual cues and low arousal contextual cues scenarios (17 smokers with low nicotine dependency were excluded). An eye-tracker system was used to evaluate attention toward these cues. Eye fixation on smoking-related cues differed between smokers and nonsmokers, indicating that smokers focused more often on smoking-related cues than nonsmokers. Self-reports of craving are in agreement with these results and suggest a significant increase in craving after exposure to smoking cues.

Given that popular virtual worlds (e. g., Second Life [SL]) are often criticized for White-avatar dominance or White bias, we examined the psychological effects of the alleged White dominance in avatar-based virtual worlds by conducting two experiments in which participants read fictitious profiles of SL resident avatars. White and non-White participants were randomly assigned to view either a set of White-dominant avatar profiles or a set of racially diverse ones. After reading the profiles, participants had an opportunity to customize avatars using the SL interface. The findings of Experiment 1 (n = 59) revealed that non-White participants exposed to the White-dominant avatar profiles, when compared with those exposed to the racially diverse profiles, reported significantly lower levels of sense of belonging and intention to participate in SL. Experiment 2 (n = 64) demonstrated that non-White participants exposed to the White-dominant avatar profiles gave significantly higher estimation of the White user population within SL; the data also showed that exposure to the White-dominant avatar profiles resulted in a greater sense of limitation on skin customization among non-White participants than among White participants. The present research suggests that ethno-racial minorities, when exposed to avatar-based cues that signal White dominance, may perceive the virtual world as identity threatening, thereby feeling psychologically disconnected and detached from it.

Findings suggested that in general, digital game interactivity predicted higher self-efficacy compared with noninteractive passive games. However, in the noninteractive conditions, the effects of performance on self-efficacy were moderated by perceived similarity between the observer and the observed player. When the observed player was perceived to be similar to the observer, the effects of performance on self-efficacy were comparable to the interactive game, but when the observed player was perceived as dissimilar to the observer, observing the dissimilar player failed to increase observer self-efficacy.

The analysis shows that social organizations attempted to make news through scheduling their actions in association with multiple temporalities and through engaging the established political institutions on the issue.

Third, this realization is not an isolated event in Korean society, and different national and global democratic alliances emerge to support MWTV.

Gender stereotypes are proposed to be either an asset or a liability depending on the particulars of campaign theme and advertising style. Through two experiments (with samples of 281 and 270 eligible voters, respectively), participants made inferences about unfamiliar candidates based on stimuli manipulated in the ad. Campaign theme was manipulated in the contexts of candidates' gendered personality traits and issue domain. Administration of the experiments was performed via a shopping mall intercept method. The experimental results indicated that congruity between candidate gender and campaign theme would enhance a positive political ad. Female candidates showing 'feminine' traits, or focusing on 'soft' issues, could encourage voters' favourable evaluations and increase their voting intention. Conversely, it was more advantageous for men to campaign with a focus on 'masculine' traits or 'hard' issues. However, when resorting to an attack ad, the opposite patterns held true: i.e. complementarity between candidate gender and campaign theme enhanced persuasion in advertising.

According to the findings, the age of a child, parental perception of the negative influence of the internet, parental perception of their child's low self-control, and parental internet skills were significant predictors of restrictive mediation. Restrictive mediation was significantly associated with reduced online risks and reduced time spent online, and was not associated with addictive use. In particular, the effects of restrictive mediation on online time and online risks were greater for a child with low self-control.

This issue came to the fore during the mass candlelight protests in Seoul in 2008 against the then newly elected conservative government's resumption of American beef imports despite public concern over the credibility of US food regulation. Born out of the beef protests was a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of individual citizens who called for media reform, condemning what they saw as Chojoongdong's biased dominance of public discourse. Based on an ethnographic study of the inception and evolution of this digitally mediated network, Eonsoju, from 2008 to 2013, this article discusses the spatial opportunities and institutional challenges of digital activism.

This article considers one type of online visual political communication, the online political poster, in terms of its strategic campaign functions relating to persuasive and organizational roles. The article uses a case study of an extensive data set of online political posters collected from political parties in the United Kingdom, on Facebook, between September 2013 through to and including the general election in May 2015, to try to understand how parties used online political posters and how audiences responded to them. The findings show that despite a clear emphasis on sharing images, very few received widespread attention, arguably limiting their persuasive role.

In describing or discussing these tragic events, labels such as European migrant crisis and European refugee crisis started being widely used by the media, politicians, and the online world alike. The use of such labels has the potential to dictate the ways in which displaced people are received and perceived. With this study, we investigate label use in social media (specifically YouTube), the emergent patterns of labeling that can cause further disaffection and tension or elicit sympathy, and the sentiments associated with the different labels. Our findings suggest that migration issues are being framed not only through labels characterizing the crisis but also by their describing the individuals themselves. Using topic modeling and sentiment analysis jointly, our study offers valuable insights into the direction of public sentiment and the nature of discussions surrounding this significant societal crisis, as well as the nature of online opinion sharing. We conclude by proposing a four-dimensional model of label interpretation in relation to sentimentthat accounts for perceived agency, economic cost, permanence, and threat, and identifies threat and agency to be most impactful. This perspective reveals important influential aspects of labels and frames that may shape online public opinion and alter attitudes toward those directly affected by the crisis.","| Erasmus Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Rotterdam, Netherlands (1) | KNAW Humanities Cluster, DHLab, Amsterdam, Netherlands (2)","Refugee or Migrant Crisis?

Thou soo is a solution-focused speech act, and aih auan, a lamentation about situations that are irreversible and beyond the speaker's control. Thou soo implies power in the speaker, but also carries with it risk and tension. Aih auan affords the speaker a less influential position, but has the potential of creating empathetic bonds with others and providing future wisdom. We explore in detail these folk concepts and their implications for cultural knowledge and community-connected communication in general.","| Western Washington Univ, Dept Commun, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA (1) | Utah State Univ, Dept Languages Philosophy & Speech Commun, Logan, UT 84322 USA (2)",Thou Soo and Aih Auan: Communicating Dissatisfaction in a Chinese Malaysian Community,"Lee, Ee Lin (1)| Hall, Bradford J.

Lee, YH ,,"This research proposes an additional method (with potential advantages) of manipulating ad message involvement (AMI) through ad information expectancy. This manipulation of ad information characteristics showed that unexpected information creates a higher AMI than does expected information. lit addition, the immediate and delayed effects of ad information expectancy on attitude evaluation, confidence, and recall are examined. In particular, attitude evaluation and confidence responded differently under different times of response and levels of AMI. Under immediate responses, ads with unexpected information (high AMI) produced more favorable attitude evaluation than did ads with expected information (low AMI). However, no differences in attitude confidences were found between the two conditions. Under delayed responses, both attitude evaluation and confidence were significantly higher in the unexpected than in the expected conditions. In addition, although delayed ad and brand confidences under low AMI were low, ad and brand attitudes remained significantly correlated with each other. These findings suggest that 1) assessing both attitude evaluation and attitude confidence is important especially when studying delayed attitudinal effects of advertising, and 2) high AMI through the introduction of unexpected information in ads creates relatively persistent and favorable attitudes.","| Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mkt, Singapore 117548, Singapore (1)",Manipulating ad message involvement through information expectancy: Effects on attitude evaluation and confidence,"Lee, YH (1)",,SUM 2000,2000,JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING,WOS:000165580800003,TRUE,842,,35.95,16.33,42.22,0.97,2.64,1.89,"Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mkt, Singapore 117548, Singapore",,,1

Lee,Sangwon,10.1016/j.tele.2014.10.005,"Continuous innovations in the telecommunications industry marked by media and technological convergence enable consumers to access television and video content through various fixed and mobile broadband networks and devices. As evidence of this trend, the diffusion of new interactive, converged video services like Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) shows a rapid growth in many countries. In spite of a growing body of scholarship on IPTV diffusion, there is currently no empirical work that examines IPTV diffusion at the macro-level. This study fills this void in the literature by examining the macro-level factors influencing IPTV diffusion through regression analysis. Data analysis suggests inter-modal competition between different broadband technologies is more effective than intra-modal competition (local loop unbundling policy) in promoting IPTV diffusion. Results also indicate that pay TV market size contributes to IPTV diffusion. It appears that, in many countries, IPTV is more likely to be deployed as the market size of pay TV services increases.

It examines the competing theoretical models of core-periphery and cluster structures. The initial results show lowered centralization and inequality in the network of international telecommunications traffic.

The present experiment investigated how social category representation via avatars (i.e., graphical representations of people in computer-mediated environments) affects stereotype-relevant task performance. In particular, building on and extending the Proteus effect model, we explored whether and how stereotype lift (i.e., a performance boost caused by the awareness of a domain-specific negative stereotype associated with outgroup members) occurred in virtual group settings in which avatar-based gender representation was arbitrary. Female and male participants (N=120) were randomly assigned either a female avatar or a male avatar through a process masked as a random drawing. They were then placed in a numerical minority status with respect to virtual gender-as the only virtual female (male) in a computer-mediated triad with two opposite-gendered avatars-and performed a mental arithmetic task either competitively or cooperatively. The data revealed that participants who were arbitrarily represented by a male avatar and competed against two ostensible female avatars showed strongest performance compared to others on the arithmetic task. This pattern occurred regardless of participants' actual gender, pointing to a virtual stereotype lift effect. Additional mediation tests showed that task motivation partially mediated the effect. Theoretical and practical implications for social identity dynamics in avatar-based virtual environments are discussed.","| Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA (1) | Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA (2)",Does the Mask Govern the Mind?: Effects of Arbitrary Gender Representation on Quantitative Task Performance in Avatar-Represented Virtual Groups,"ee, Jong-Eun Roselyn (1)| Nass, Clifford I.

In particular, we propose and test a communication mediation model of youth socialization, in which interdependent communication processes located in the family, schools, media, and peer networks combine to cultivate communication competence, a set of basic communication skills and motives needed for active and informed participation in public life. Analysis of our panel data indicates that participation in deliberative classroom activities and democratic peer norms contribute to civic activism among youth. These peer and school influences, however, are found to be largely indirect, working through informational use of conventional and online news media, and expression and discussion of political ideas outside of classroom and family boundaries. In particular, our findings highlight strong online pathways to participation, centering on news consumption and political expression via digital media technologies, suggesting the key role of the Internet in this dynamic.","| Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29424 USA (1) | Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA (2)",Processes of Political Socialization: A Communication Mediation Approach to Youth Civic Engagement,"ee, Nam-Jin (1)| Shah, Dhavan V.

This study examines this phenomenon in journalism, building on a revised theoretical model that accounts for greater audience engagement in the gatekeeping process. Research suggests that news editors, after long resisting or ignoring audience preferences, are becoming increasingly aware of and adaptive to consumer tastes as manifest via metrics. However, research also finds a gap in the news preferences of editors and audiences. This study asks: Who influences whom more in this disparity? Through longitudinal secondary data analysis of three U.S. online newspapers, and using structural equation modeling, this study finds that (a) audience clicks affect subsequent news placement, based on time-lagged analysis; (b) such influence intensifies during the course of the day; (c) there is no overall lagged effect of news placement on audience clicks; and (d) the lagged effect of audience clicks on news placement is stronger than the inverse.

By assessing the processes wherein the joint workings of cross-cutting discussion and strong tie homogeneity are simultaneously associated with the outcomes of deliberative and participatory democracy, we provide a number of key insights into the puzzling quandary. First, our results indicate that cross-cutting discussion and strong tie homogeneity interact with each other to predict increased political participation. Second, the relationship between cross-cutting discussion and preference for open dialogue is stronger for those who belong to a congenial primary network. Third, efficacious individuals seem more capable of translating the benefits of an ongoing deliberative orientation into meaningful political behavior.

We contend that the meanings of Tiananmen were reconstructed over twenty years partly but not completely in line with the changes in the United States' policy toward China. Specifically, Tiananmen symbolized Communist dictatorship in the initial years after 1989 and then became an example of China's human rights abuse in the late 1990s. Into the 2000s, the significance of Tiananmen faded away. But it remained as part of United States' ritualistic memory of China's repression that invokes the moral bottom line of U.S. foreign policy.

Our findings support the regulatory fit theory. When learners experienced regulatory fit, they played the game for 26% longer time than learners who did not experience regulatory fit. Learners in regulatory fit conditions also displayed more learning-related behaviors such as spending more time on learning feedback both during gameplay and between gameplay sessions. Positive feedback seems to motivate promotion-oriented learners; however, negative feedback did not demotivate prevention-oriented learners as theory predicted.","| Michigan State Univ, Dept Telecommun Informat Studies & Media, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA (1) | Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Digital Media, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA (2) | Elect Arts, Redwood City, CA USA (3)",Feeling Right About How You Play: The Effects of Regulatory Fit in Games for Learning,"e, Yu-Hao (1)| Heeter, Carrie (2)| Magerko, Brian (3)| Medler, Ben (4)","digital game-based learning,motivations,regulatory fit,serious games",13-Jul,2013,GAMES AND CULTURE,WOS:000323637800004,FALSE,19,corrected,35.95,16.33,42.22,0.97,2.64,1.89,"Michigan State Univ, Dept Telecommun Informat Studies & Media, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA",,,1

These findings have led researchers to suggest that mobile phone use may pose a legitimately addictive behavior for some people. Other research has suggested negative effects of mobile phones on academic outcomes. To study the effects of phone separation on both anxiety and attainment of academic study goals, we randomly assigned participants (N = 93) to a restricted mobile phone access condition or a control condition. After setting a list of goals for a study session, participants worked on their own, self-chosen class materials for 60 minutes. Anxiety was measured before and immediately following the study session. Attainment of study goals was assessed through a self-report estimate of the percent of study goals accomplished at the end of the session. We predicted that those who classified as high on a problematic mobile phone use scale and who had their phones taken away would show the greatest increases in anxiety over the session as well as the greatest deficits in attainment of study goals as compared to all other participants. While there was a general tendency for participants who scored higher on the problematic use scale to be more anxious, anxiety did not differ between participants with phone access and those without it. Participants without phone access self-reported attainment of 12% more of their study goals than those who had phones.

Four hundred undergraduate women, 30% of whom had previously had a one-night stand (ONS) with differing degrees of lingering regret, watched one of six versions of a television program representing ONS behavior. Results largely replicated earlier research (Nabi, Finnerty, Domschke, & Hull, 2006) in terms of program enjoyment and regret reduction. Further, self-forgiveness emerged as the single predictor of regret reduction, though it also increased perceived likelihood of a future ONS. Conversely, learning from past mistakes associated with higher post-viewing regret, but lower perceived ONS likelihood. The complicated role of entertainment media as coping devices and the need to explore message features the might promote effective coping are emphasized.","| Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA (1)",Why Misery Loves Company: The Role of Self-Forgiveness in Reducing Regret Through Media Consumption,"Nabi, Robin L.

Envy maintained a significantly greater association with behavioral motivation than hope or any other emotional response.

Or, even more basic, what feature most centrally defines emotion? Although undoubtedly conceptually important, the more pressing question for scholars within our discipline is: which approach to emotion is most useful for understanding communication-based phenomena-the discrete or the dimensional view? Here I argue that, although these two perspectives share some very basic root elements, we must look for the best match between the phenomena under consideration and the unique strengths of the theoretical paradigms applied to them. Given the complexity of communication-related processes and outcomes, the more complex orientation to the study of emotion-the discrete emotion perspective-is most useful as what little might be lost in parsimony is more than offset by the precision gained in prediction. In this essay, I will first define emotion and the two major approaches to its study. I will then argue that given that unique emotion states ( generated by unique appraisal patterns) are the key motivator behind differences in human thought, word, and deed, it is most reasonable to adopt a discrete perspective to the extent those outcomes are of interest.

This article presents evidence that belies this notion. Based on a survey of 1250 Philadelphia adults, a clear and consistent pattern emerged suggesting that beliefs related to domestic violence correlate with intentions to act with respect to domestic violence but rarely correlate with reported actions (e.g., talking to the abused woman). Numerous methodological and substantive explanations for this finding are offered with emphasis placed on the complexity of the context in which an action to prevent a domestic violence incident occurs. We conclude by arguing that despite the small, insignificant relationships between beliefs and behaviors found, worthwhile aggregate effects on behavior might still exist, thus reaffirming the role of communication campaign efforts.","| Univ Arizona, Dept Commun, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA (1) | Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA (2)",Predicting intentions versus predicting behaviors: Domestic violence prevention from a theory of reasoned action perspective,"abi, RL (1)| Southwell, B (2)| Hornik, R (3)",,2002,2002,HEALTH COMMUNICATION,WOS:000178276900002,FALSE,1625,corrected,35.37,0,47.83,0,12.2,2.44,"Univ Arizona, Dept Commun, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,,1

One hundred and forty-four participants, half of whom had been unfaithful in romantic relationships, were asked first to rate their interest in viewing a series of storylines and then to provide their reactions to I of 2 versions of a TV program depicting cheating behavior. Largely consistent with hypotheses, results indicated that those who had both cheated and felt regret about their behavior were more likely than others to want to watch experience-related storylines, were no less likely to enjoy watching such programming, and particularly preferred viewing the program version in which the main character rationalized, rather than expressed regret for, her behavior. Both program versions, however, reduced regret equally. A survey of 206 city residents also offered evidence consistent with predictions based on regret theory. Overall, this research speaks to the value of integrating theories of emotion with media theory to enhance the latter's predictive ability.","| Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA (1) | Univ Arizona, Dept Commun, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA (2) | Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA (3)",Does misery love company?

Although media scholars have suggested media use may be driven by a need to relax, related research has been sporadic and, until recently, disconnected from the larger conversation about stress management. The present research aimed to determine the relative value of media use within the broader range of coping strategies. Based on surveys of both students and breast cancer patients, media use emerged as one of the most frequently selected strategies for managing stress across a range of personality and individual difference variables. Further, heavier television consumers and those with higher perceived stress were also more likely to use media for coping purposes. Finally, those who choose media for stress management reported it to be an effective tool, although perhaps not as effective as other popular strategies. This research not only documents the centrality of media use in the corpus of stress management techniques, thus highlighting the value of academic inquiry into media-based coping, but it also offers evidence supporting the positive role media use can play in promoting psychological well-being.","| UC Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA (1)",Guilty Pleasure No More The Relative Importance of Media Use for Coping With Stress,"abi, Robin L.

In Study 1, 212 undergraduates read one of four monologues by political comedian Bill Maher. Correlations and path modeling suggested that, in general, humor associated with greater source liking, closer information processing, and reduced counterargument, but also with greater message discounting. In Study 2, 204 undergraduates read one of four versions of a message based on the comedy of Chris Rock, manipulated to be more or less funny and attributed to the comedian or not. Results largely replicated those from Study 1. In addition, the humorous messages promoted more discounting than the serious messages, though they were processed with comparable depth. Although no more likely to be persuasive in the short run, the comedic transcript evidenced a sleeper effect after one week. In sum, the data were consistent with the notion that humorous messages might be processed carefully (but not critically) yet simultaneously discounted as irrelevant to attitudinal judgments.

Yar, Majid ,10.1177/1741659012443227,"This paper considers the ways in which the rise of new media might challenge commonplace criminological assumptions about the crime-media interface. Established debates around crime and media have long been based upon a fairly clear demarcation between production and consumption, between object and audience - the media generates and transmits representations of crime, and audiences engage with them. However, one of the most noticeable changes occurring in the wake of the development of new media is the proliferation of self-organised production by 'ordinary people' - everything ranging from self-authored web pages and 'blogs', to self-produced video created using hand-held camcorders, camera-phones and 'webcams'. Today we see the spectacle of people performing acts of crime and deviance in order to record them, send them and upload them to the Internet. This kind of 'will to representation' may be seen in itself as a new kind of causal inducement to law- and rule-breaking behaviour. It may be that, in the new media age, the terms of criminological questioning need to be sometimes reversed: instead of asking whether 'media' instigates crime or fear of crime, we must ask how the very possibility of mediating oneself to an audience through self-representation might be bound up with the genesis of criminal behaviour.","| Univ Hull, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England (1)","Crime, media and the will-to-representation: Reconsidering relationships in the new media age","Yar, Majid (1)","demotic production,digital culture,mediation,new media,self-representation",12-Dec,2012,CRIME MEDIA CULTURE,WOS:000311478400001,TRUE,82,,35.04,8.03,44.16,0,7.66,0,"Univ Hull, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",,,1

Such linear models prescribe one-way knowledge, information, and transmission of beliefs from the core health sectors to the subalterns at the margins.

This co-constructive research investigates how members of a Bangladeshi rural community define, construct, and negotiate health issues in their everyday lives through their narratives of health, illness, and healing. The findings explicate how the community participants negotiate their health in terms of poverty, work, and structure, and highlights how the participants negotiate their marginalization through communicative practices.

The odds of participants in each segment adopting mammography during the follow-up period were calculated. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify psychological predictors (five attitudes to mammography and perceived health competence) of transition to upper segments (S1 vs. S2, S2 vs. S3, S3 vs. S4, S4 vs. S5). Compared to S5, other segments did not undertake mammography at significant rates during the follow-up. The following were significant predictors for inclusion in upper segments: Lack of importance and perceived health competence were associated with inclusion in S2; lack of importance and barriers to screening were associated with inclusion in S3; perceived health competence was associated with inclusion in S4; and lack of importance was associated with inclusion in S5. These results confirm the predictive validity of a segmentation strategy, and indicate that there might be specific key factors for each segment in promoting mammography adoption.","| Waseda Univ, Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan (1) | Waseda Univ, Fac Sports Sci, Tokyo, Japan (2) | Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med & Support, Off Large Scale Educ & Res Projects, Dept Complementary & Alternat Med, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan (3) | Hosei Univ, Fac Letters, Dept Psychol, Tokyo, Japan (4) | Jichi Med Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan (5)",Worry and Intention Among Japanese Women: Implications for an Audience Segmentation Strategy to Promote Mammography Adoption,", Kazuhiro (1)| Hirai, Kei (2)| Arai, Hirokazu (3)| Ishikawa, Yoshiki (4)| Fukuyoshi, Jun (5)| Hamashima, Chisato (6)| Saito, Hiroshi (7)| Shibuya, Daisuke (8)",,OCT 1 2013,2013,HEALTH COMMUNICATION,WOS:000325243600008,TRUE,951,,34.5,2.36,54.58,0,6.2,0,"Waseda Univ, Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan",,,1

Through contrast and critique, the essay reveals the difficulty for any ethico-political project within the digital and argues that the present post-modern relationship with computing, in which market forces' determine technological forms and applications, is socially destructive and must be brought under a new aegis of democratic and common responsibility.","| Univ Melbourne, Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic, Australia (1)","Digital, ethical, political: Network time and common responsibility","Hassan, Robert (1)","Computer ethics,digitality,network society,politics,responsibility,time",18-Jul,2018,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,WOS:000438601800016,TRUE,1525,,33.76,38.95,19.2,0.24,4.72,3.14,"Univ Melbourne, Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,,1
Ling, Rich ,10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01520.x,"""SMS has grown to be a common form of interaction in Norwegian society. Its adoption started among teens but has since been taken into use by other age groups. However, the use patterns for teens seem to be different from those of older users. This paper examines the assertion that SMS is a life phase and not a cohort phenomenon. That is, its use is more intense among teens and more moderate among older age groups. Data for the analysis comes from a series of six nation-wide surveys of Norwegians over the age of 13. Questions on the reported use of SMS were included in all these surveys. This information was adjusted in order to remove the effects of generally increased use over time. The analysis shows that the proportion of text messages sent by different age groups stays rather stable over time. Indeed there seems to be a type of """"standing wave"""" of use associated with older teens and those in their early 20s. While there are cohort effects visible in the data, the analysis indicates that texting is largely a life phase phenomenon. If the curve had flattened out with time it would have indicated that the teens are carrying texting with them as they grow older. This, it seems is not the case. The overall use of SMS has increased in Norwegian society but the relative distribution of the text messages has remained centered around those in their late teens.

Conflicts between male friends could escalate from verbal to physical aggression, whereas female friends were likely to sabotage other close relationships that threatened the friendship.

The use of virtual sampling was combined with an online questionnaire as a complementary tool for Web 2.0 research in behavioural sciences.', """"Findings - The number of cases detected by Facebook and the virtual response rate is higher than traditional snowball technique.

Research has shown that real-world social networks have a significant influence on one's health behavior and outcomes. However, there is a dearth of studies on how individuals form social networks in virtual space and whether such online social networks exert any impact on individuals' health outcomes. Built on the Multi-Theoretical Multilevel (MTML) framework and drawing from literature on social influence, this study examined the mechanisms underlying the formation of an online health social network and empirically tested social influence on individual health outcomes through the network. Situated in a weight management social networking site, the study tracked a health buddy network of 709 users and their weight management activities and outcomes for 4months.

Possible reasons are discussed for the study having found little evidence that children transform ideas taken from television and videos when composing stories; it is suggested that the nature of the image on the screen is equivalent neither to actual experience nor to the visualized image, and may play a different role in the creative process. The article concludes by positing the notion that the ubiquity and ease of access to television and videos perhaps robs today's children of the need to pursue their own thoughts and devise their own occupations, distracting them from inner processes and constantly demanding responses to external agendas, and suggests that this may have implications for the development of imaginative capacity.","| Univ E Anglia, Ctr Appl Res Educ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England (1)",Television and imagination: an investigation of the medium's influence on children's story-making,"Belton, T (1)","boredom,capturing,firing,perception,play",1-Nov,2001,MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY,WOS:000173323200007,TRUE,703,,30.49,62.06,0.62,0.44,3.04,3.34,"Univ E Anglia, Ctr Appl Res Educ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",,,1

Discarding history is an especially fraught outcome of the turn away from Enlightenment values. Where history might inform, say, public debate and policy-making on and for the media, it is instead largely ignored. In consequence, the Enlightenment concept of free expression is now by no means seen as a crucial public good, the key human right. The history of the struggle for press freedom is forgotten. The basic principle of free speech is abridged and adjusted for non-print media as with current British communications regulatory structures. However, it can be argued that all of the received legitimations for media-specific content controls above the general law - from supposed spectrum scarcity through to the public right to know - are poorly grounded. Their undebated general acceptance dangerously undermines the concept of free expression. Yet, as Garnham reminds us, for Kant and his successors emancipation depended on enlightenment which in turn depended on publicity - the free exchange of ideas about the world and about social relations with fellow citizens in order to arrive at truth and a freely chosen and shared moral community.","| Lincoln Univ, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England (1)","Emancipation, the media and modernity: some reflections on Garnham's Kantian turn","Winston, B (1)","enlightenment,free expression,Kant,media regulation",5-Jul,2005,MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY,WOS:000230927600003,TRUE,170,,30.3,62.66,0.73,0.28,3.65,2.38,"Lincoln Univ, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England",,,1

Inspired by Buber's work the article argues that dialogue and strategic communication both have the potential to be deployed ethically, and for prosocial causes, or to be deployed in a self-serving and unethical way. In this, it supports other scholars' argument that public relations should reconcile with the fact that both are legitimate tools and it further argues that both might be used either ethically or unethically.

This paper updates consideration of the influence of inter-profession disputes by examining the interplay between public relations and advertising in the digital age. It attempts to assess how new technologies, especially social media, affect the relationships between them, with particular reference to two aspects: whether social media increases, or decreases, professional cooperation (or competition); and who takes charge in the new communication environment. In researching these issues, which form an important part of the professionalization process of public relations, the paper examined documents and online publications, and undertook interviews and a survey of public relations practitioners in New Zealand. The findings suggest that the responding public relations practitioners were not able to take advantage of the social technology in order to leverage their professional status and improve their position within the organization. In addition, it seems that while advertising and public relations are still looking for ways to benefit from social media, both are still in a process of adaptation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The defendant in this case was not the media but rather a company that hired a public relations firm to, according to the judgement, conduct a defamatory campaign against a competitor. Although this is just one case in one country, the article also considers some of the wider implications for the profession and for democracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Inspired by the centrality of community and community building concepts in the public relations literature (Hallahan, 2013), we argue that the role of PR in facilitating community networks deserves scholarly investigation. Based on a survey and interview material, our study finds that current democratic and inclusive networks might operate with no help from professional PR services, but network facilitators, who are not trained in public relations, use PR skills. Finally, we conclude that, on ethical and reputational grounds, PR practitioners should not exploit online/offline networks to influence the network members by promoting organizational interests in ways that may damage communities.

This article presents an empirical study regarding the space given over to pundits in mainstream Portuguese print media between 1980 and 2005, a period of significant change in Portugal. It is argued that, seen as a public space, punditry can be conceived as an indicator of the democratization process in Portugal. This study aims to analyze how the changes that took place in Portuguese media and society affected the pundits' world, their profile and the presence of women in their midst. This study aims to answer several questions: Who are the Portuguese media pundits? Where do they come from? Is this a balanced gender space? What was the impact of structural changes in the media sector and Portuguese society throughout the past 26 years, with regards to the space occupied by pundits?

As new global flows of capital in media industries have been emerging, it is relevant to consider how investors from autocratic political regimes with illiberal views on the media articulate with Western culture's founding prerogatives of media and journalism. To do this, we singled out the Angola-Portugal relationship.

Real, Kevin ,,"Peer communication represents I mechanism through which norms are disseminated in social groups. The theory of normative social behavior (TNSB) posits that group identity, outcome expectations, and injunctive norms moderate the relation between descriptive norms and behaviors. This article extends the purview of the TNSB by conceptualizing peer communication as another moderator in the relationship between descriptive norms and behaviors. A survey was conducted among college students (N = 675) to measure their normative perceptions, peer communication, alcohol consumption, alcohol-related consequences, and intention to drink alcohol. As hypothesized, descriptive norms, peer communication, and the interaction between these two variables were significantly associated with consumption, even after controlling for known predictors of both consumption and various mechanisms of normative influences. Controlling for prior consumption, peer communication was also a significant predictor of intention to consume alcohol in the future. This model explained approximately 63% of the variance in intention. This study found a significant relationship between peer communication and alcohol drinking behaviors and intentions after controlling for perceived norms.","| Univ Kentucky, Dept Commun, Lexington, KY 40506 USA (1) | Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA (2)",Friends talk to friends about drinking: Exploring the role of peer communication in the theory of normative social Behavior,"Real, Kevin (1)| Rimal, Rajiv N.

The focus of this research is to examine workplace safety using health communication theory and research. A field study using a random sample of production workers (n=645) in a manufacturing organization was conducted, to investigate individuals' risk perception and efficacy beliefs and to validate the predictions of the risk perception attitude framework. Results were consistent with the theory, as risk and efficacy jointly predicted safety behavior, behavioral intentions, and safety information-seeking intentions. Given a particular level of risk, those with greater efficacy beliefs displayed more positive safety outcomes than those with lower efficacy beliefs. The responsive group (high risk, high efficacy) reported safer outcomes than the avoidant group (high risk, low efficacy) and the proactive group (low risk, high efficacy) reported safer outcomes than the indifferent group (low risk, low efficacy).

This multimethod study was conducted on two floors of a newly designed urban hospital. Nine focus groups interviews were conducted with 35 health care professionals from 10 provider groups. Seven of the groups were homogeneous by profession or level: nursing (three groups), nurse managers (two groups), and one group each of nurse care technicians (techs) and physicians. Two mixed groups were comprised of staff from pharmacy, occupational therapy, patient care facilitators, physical therapy, social work, and pastoral care. Systematic qualitative analysis was conducted using a conceptual framework based on systems theory and prior health care design and communication research. Additionally, quantitative modeling was employed to assess walking distances in two different hospital designs. Results indicate nurses walked significantly more in the new hospital environment. Qualitative analysis revealed three insights developed in relationship to system structures, processes, and outcomes. First, decentralized nurse stations changed system interdependencies by reducing nurse-to-nurse interactions and teamwork while heightening nurse interdependencies and teamwork with other health care occupations. Second, many nursing-related processes remained centralized while nurse stations were decentralized, creating systems-based problems for nursing care. Third, nursing communities of practices were adversely affected by the new design. Implications of this study suggest that nurse station design shapes communication, patient care processes, and patient outcomes. Further, it is important to understand how the built environment, often treated as invisible in communication research, is crucial to understanding communication within complex health care systems.","| Univ Kentucky, Dept Commun, Lexington, KY 40506 USA (1) | Univ Kentucky, Grad Ctr Gerontol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA (2) | Univ Kentucky, Sanders Brown Ctr Aging, Lexington, KY 40506 USA (3) | Natl Comm Qual Assurance, Marshfield, WI USA (4)","The Role of the Built Environment: How Decentralized Nurse Stations Shape Communication, Patient Care Processes, and Patient Outcomes","eal, Kevin (1)| Bardach, Shoshana H.

Political success is often credited cleverly crafted communication strategies. The Norwegian Labour Party applied methods similar to those found in Nazi Germany as of 1933/34, luring voters away from the dogmatic Right and Left, to the leftist social democratic movement. One key-element of this highly successful strategy is the shift from a somber accentuation on methods of scientific persuasion, emphasizing a perceived rationale of a social system based in Marxism, to propaganda, bombarding masses with slogans and one-liners. Another key element is an acknowledgement of indifferent voters. The vast majority of the voter potential did not attend political meeting and were unable to recognize and separate ideologies. This led party strategists to developing methodologieson how to approach voters as crowds, not merely as individual citizens in large numbers.

In general, standard speakers were upgraded on competence-related traits but downgraded on solidarity traits irrespective of age, with older speakers being perceived as less hesitant but more benevolent than their younger counterparts. An Age x Accent interaction effect showed that older-sounding standard speakers were judged the most competent and older-sounding nonstandard speakers the least competent. favorable ratings were afforded speakers with medium rates, and slow-talking, younger-sounding speakers were particularly downgraded. All three independent variables affected ratings of listeners' interpretations of the (same) text, while speaker age was the only effect on the recognition of message material 2 days later.

We predicted that individuals with high levels of agreeableness would react better to a physician adopting a highly affiliative communication style compared to individuals with low levels of agreeableness. We used an experimental design with analogue patients. Eighty participants (40 men/40 women) were randomly assigned to watch a video of a physician who communicated a bad diagnosis either in a highly affiliative or in a less affiliative way. Participants reported their reactions of anger and trust in the physician, and completed the agreeableness scale of the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). In accordance with our predictions, the higher the agreeableness score of the participants, the less anger and the more trust they reported after viewing the high as compared to the low affiliative physician.

With the view that the accuracy or truth of the 'sensational message' can change, either evolving naturally within our collective perception or through more deliberate ways, this then presents some scenarios in which ever more flexible notions of truth in the future may provide not only challenges but also opportunities. Using different perspectives but always with a bit of lightheartedness, two events that are separated by half a century and a vast expanse of technological advances are presented as lenses with which to examine our collective obsession of the sensational and how this obsession may influence our perspective as well as our subsequent choices. Looking towards the increasingly connected future, the challenges and economic implications of our susceptibility to sensational media are explored so that in the end, the readers will have gained insights on mass media's power to flex our notions of truth.

It was hypothesized that when two racial groups are compared, people would perceive the relatively more at-risk group to be more, and the less at-risk group to be less, at-risk than if the same risk information was presented without the comparative reference group. Three experiments with Black and White respondents tested effects of intergroup social comparison framing (SCF) on perceptions of risk for sexually transmitted infections and skin cancer. SCF (including one White and two Black disparity frames) did not raise respondents' perceived risk regarding the more at-risk racial group, but consistently lowered respondents' risk ratings for the less at-risk racial group.

Although a majority of respondents indicated they were unlikely to intervene to voice objections about SHSe and SHVe in public venues, this study suggests that incidental or intentional messages and policies that influence perceptions of risk, norms, and efficacy could affect willingness to voice objections about others' vaping and smoking in public.","| Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, 3001 Lincoln Hall,702 S Wright St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA (1) | Northeastern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Coll Arts Media & Design, Boston, MA 02115 USA (2) | Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, E Lansing, MI USA (3) | Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA (4) | Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Community Based Res, Div Populat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA (5)",Speaking up about Lighting up in Public: Examining Psychosocial Correlates of Smoking and Vaping Assertive Communication Intentions among US Adults,"gman, Cabral A.

The significant interaction term of invasiveness and privacy concern indicates that both attitude and behavioural intention were diminished, particularly when perceived invasiveness and privacy concern were high simultaneously.

Although not successful in getting foundation funds, Sandage was instrumental in publishing Occasional Papers in Advertising as a forerunner of a journal. Other individuals became involved with the quest for a journal, eventually securing sufficient funds to start, and Volume 1, Number 1 of the Journal of Advertising appeared in 1972. Governance of the Journal was in the hands of a self-perpetuating Board of Directors, with loose ties to the American Academy of Advertising. This arrangement was due to philosophical differences between those desirous of establishing a journal and the then Executive Committee of the Academy. Monetary problems and differences in viewpoint of journal content plagued those responsible for the Journal in its earlier years. By 1979, efforts were underway to merge the autonomous Journal Board of Directors into a Publications Committee within the Academy proper.

This study extends situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) by applying it to paracrisis situations as well as by testing a cognitive model in which breach of expectation by different actors leads to different degrees of judgment of responsibility and counterfactual thinking processes (i.e., the person could/would/should have done something else). A deny crisis response (e.g., scapegoating) was effective in reducing blame and negative affective responses and yielded less negative reputation assessment of the message source. The expectation breach led participants to engage in a counterfactual thinking process, which in turn evoked greater indignation and more negative reputation assessment. Indignation and negative reputation were both significant predictors of online word-of-mouth intention.

Roh, Sungjong ,10.1080/10410236.2015.1037420,"This study uses data from systematic Web image search results and two randomized survey experiments to analyze how frames commonly used in public debates about health issues, operationalized here as alternative word choices, influence public support for health policy reforms. In Study 1, analyses of Bing (N=1,719), Google (N=1,872), and Yahoo Images (N=1,657) search results suggest that the images returned from the search query sugar-sweetened beverage are more likely to evoke health-related concepts than images returned from a search query about soda. In contrast, soda search queries were more likely to incorporate brand-related concepts than sugar-sweetened beverage search queries. In Study 2, participants (N=206) in a controlled Web experiment rated their support for policies to reduce consumption of these drinks. As expected, strong liberals had more support for policies designed to reduce the consumption of these drinks when the policies referenced soda compared to sugar-sweetened beverage. To the contrary, items describing these drinks as soda produced lower policy support than items describing them as sugar-sweetened beverage among strong conservatives. In Study 3, participants (N=1,000) in a national telephone survey experiment rated their support for a similar set of policies. Results conceptually replicated the previous Web-based experiment, such that strong liberals reported greater support for a penny-per-ounce taxation when labeled soda versus sugar-sweetened beverages. In both Studies 2 and 3, more respondents referred to brand-related concepts in response to questions about sugar-sweetened beverages compared to soda.

Results indicate that the appeal is effective and that the persuasion process of threatening advertisements is led by affective reactions. In contrast to earlier research on older targets, cognitive processes do not improve its effectiveness.

Park, Sangkyu ,10.1016/j.tele.2017.06.003,"With the rapid diffusion of smart devices, retailers provide new forms of interactive communication channels, enabling their consumers to access through the mobile channel. The retailers recognize the importance of the mobile channel as an efficient sales channel and as a tool for CRM (Customer Relationship Management). However, CRM has become increasingly complex after adopting it to the mobile channel. It is imperative for retailers to understand consumer behavior in an omni-channel circumstance. Using the four-year transaction data obtained from the online home-shopping provider that expanded its online service (telephone, ARS, Internet website) onto a mobile platform, this research analyzes the consumer channel choice behavior in the perspectives of consumer sociodemographic information, consumer behavior, and corporate communication strategies. To explain channel choices in the omni-channel environment, we use multivariate probit model with sociodemographic variables, communication strategies, order hour, and product categories. Our empirical results indicate that age and gender have significant influences on channel choice behavior. Consumer fixates their inflow channel. Communication strategies such as SMS and app push alarm significantly influence consumer channel choice. Consumers using mobile channel are making purchases without time constraints, while others not. We observed that products that have characteristics of experience goods or credence goods tend to be purchased via mobile and Internet channels that provide detailed and additive information like consumer reviews. Finally, the results revealed substitution effect between most of the channels, except for the Internet and telephone.

Results from an online survey with an embedded experiment showed that issue confidence is related to an individual's motivation to engage in the GMO labeling issue, unlike factual knowledge or literacy.

Park, J ,,"This study analyzed the meaning of Hong Bo and PR as the terms appeared in three main Korean newspapers, on the basis of Spicer's seven themes. A total of 1548 mentions of the term Hong Bo and PR were analyzed as follows: First, Korean newspapers, like newspapers in the United States, tend to view Hong Bo and PR as publicity or merely PR. Thus, overall Korean newspaper reporters have a negative attitude toward the meanings of Hong Bo and PR and the reporters' viewpoint was supported by this study. Second, the uses of PR and Hong Bo were categorized as challenge, distraction, disaster, hype and merely PR. While Hong Bo was categorized more of terms as challenge, distraction and disaster than PR was, PR was categorized more of terms as hype and merely PR than Hong Bo was. This also indicates that while the meanings of Hong Bo were more negative or positive than those of PR, the meanings of PR have been used as more neutral than those of Hong Bo. The study suggests that Korean public relations practitioners and relatives have to try to lead the public to a positive attitude toward the term Hong Bo, which has been used more frequently than the term PR.

To address these aims, 327 valid questionnaires were obtained and analyzed. The original theory of consumption values (TCV) was modified to apply to the specific characteristics of online games. The original TCV specifies five types of consumption values: functional value, social value, emotional value, conditional value, and epistemic value. After revising the TCV to apply to the examination of online games, we proposed that the MTCV be composed of character competency value, enjoyment value, visual authority value, and monetary value. The validity of the MTCV was proven by statistically analyzing the responses provided by the 327 valid questionnaires. To examine the second aim, experiments were conducted to examine the MTCV in three online game genres-massive multiplayer online role-playing games, first-person shooters games, and casual games. The second aim was also studied via questionnaires that examined the ages of online gamers. It was determined that massive multiplayer online role-playing games players regard visual authority value and monetary value as more important than do casual gamers. It was also determined that younger gamers tend to be more interested in visual authority, whereas older gamers tend to be more interested in character competency. This research provides a foundation for future studies to extend the MTCV to consider other user factors, such as cultural effects.","| Sungkyunkwan Univ, SKK Business Sch, Seoul 110745, South Korea (1) | Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Interact Sci, Seoul 110745, South Korea (2)",An Empirical Analysis of Online Gamers' Perceptions of Game Items: Modified Theory of Consumption Values Approach,"Park, Bong-Won (1)| Lee, Kun Chang (2)",,JUL-AUG 2011,2011,CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,WOS:000292864100008,TRUE,486,,23.34,0.79,72.98,0.16,1.74,1,"Sungkyunkwan Univ, SKK Business Sch, Seoul 110745, South Korea",,,1

Heart rate change over time showed significant deceleration (indicative of increased cognitive resource allocation) for messages with greater ii/cc ratios.

Specific effects, however, varied fr om location to location suggesting a moderating role for self-construals. Mixed results were obtained for the link between culture and self-construals, and for the mediation model.

A variety of social network analytical methods were then applied. The results show that more top blogs have reciprocal links with politicians than have unidirectional links. The structure of hyperlink interconnectivity suggests that the ruling Uri party affiliated blogs are key in the blog network. For example, the blogs tied with the Uri party have a higher centrality and are more densely connected. Network diagrams also suggest that the top blogs are polarized by party. However, some blogs are located at the center of the Uri and GNP clusters and are connected to both camps. In other words, there are a number of citizen blogs that link to both the Uri and GNP members, because their political identities are not completely shaped but also remain between 2 different ideologies. This suggests that binary opposition in online political discourse is slowly changing.","| YeungNam Univ, Dept Commun & Informat, Gyongsan 712749, Gyeongsangbuk D, South Korea (1) | Wolverhampton Univ, Sch Comp & IT, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, W Midlands, England (2) | Wolverhampton Univ, Stat Cybermetr Res Grp, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, W Midlands, England (3)",Developing network indicators for ideological landscapes from the political blogosphere in South Korea,"Park, Han Woo (1)| Thelwall, Mike (2)","political blog,blogosphere,hyperlink analysis,social network analysis,South Korea,National Assembly,affiliation network",8-Jul,2008,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,WOS:000261112400004,TRUE,34,,23.34,0.79,72.98,0.16,1.74,1,"YeungNam Univ, Dept Commun & Informat, Gyongsan 712749, Gyeongsangbuk D, South Korea",,,1

Park, HJ ,,"Although it has few genuinely new arguments, the revived creationism discussion (particularly that based on the young-earth creationism) in America since the 1960s significantly differs from the early 1920s anti-evolution crusade in many ways, including its strategy, organizational base, and practice of public debates. The public debates in particular became a distinctive promotional activity to spread creationism. Debates, mostly held on university campuses, have brought creationists publicity and respectability, and made a significant contribution to the advancement of the movement. I will discuss how this new method of spreading creationism started, how creationists managed to manipulate the debate to serve their own cause, and how evolution defenders responded to this challenge. Creationists deliberately used the debate as a vehicle to change public perception of their image from one of backwoods ignorance associated with the old anti-evolution crusade to a respectable alternative to evolution. The popular success of this tactic explains, in part, the surprising popularity of strict creationism in American society.","| Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea (1)",The creation-evolution debate: carving creationism in the public mind,"Park, HJ (1)",,1-Apr,2001,PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE,WOS:000168620800002,TRUE,60,,23.34,0.79,72.98,0.16,1.74,1,"Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea",,,1

In this context, many government agencies are attempting to use social media tools to communicate with the public and promote citizen's trust. But, few studies have investigated the critical factors and antecedents of trust in government under social media context. Thus, this study empirically analyzes the antecedents and formation of citizen trust and expansion in actual citizen patronage behavior deploying structural equation model. The survey data was obtained from Korean population who used government's social media service. The results indicate that the formation of citizen trust in the government can be expanded into patronage intention toward social media and actual behavior. This study also demonstrates that factors related institutional-based trust, characteristic-based trust, and process based trust contribute to improving trust through government social media services.

The overall network structure and the communication pattern of users were mapped over time, and then the gatekeepers playing roles as hubs in each candidate's issue network and their framing practices were identified. Network analyses (a keyword analysis and a CONCOR analysis) were conducted and gatekeepers' political ideologies were identified. The results indicate that issue networks evolved in concert with the viewership of televised debates. According to the profile analysis of gatekeepers and the keyword analysis, gatekeepers on Twitter formed homogenous groups in terms of their political ideologies and geographic locations. In addition, Twitter users tended to form networks critical of the major conservative candidate, whereas they constructed networks of support for the major opposite candidate.

The adoption of digital learning device such as e-books amongst Korean students is accelerated by its nation-wide high mobile connectivity. When children adopt such new technology, parents are often the buyers, while the children are the actual users. To date, within the technology adoption literature, little is known about where buyers and users are different entities, and even less is known within the context of family. By filling this gap, the purpose of this research is to examine the parents' perceived notion of their child's propensity to accept a new product. By extending the technology acceptance model (TAM), we considered two additional factors: perceived playfulness and risk. Results show that unlike in traditional TAM research, when buyers are not the users of the new product, the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use differently influence attitude formation. We also found that perceived playfulness can offset perceived risk, which is highly associated with using a new product.

Among the 35,432 posts collected, we examined the most highly propagated posts and coded them for message characteristics. Our findings revealed that posts in which the source of a narrative (""""testimony"""") was identified (was either from an anorexic poster or about another's anorexia) and which were positive toward the pro-anorexia perspective were more likely to be propagated on Tumblr. In addition, posts containing content that references an anorexic person and contains an affective tone were more likely to be propagated.

A public service announcement (PSA) comprised of a realistic body image photo and a text emphasizing genetic diversity of body types improved young women's body satisfaction, although it did not affect the size of ideal female-body norm. A variation of the PSA, an alignment ad, generated a similarly positive effect on body satisfaction. The alignment ad, in comparison to a control, also increased the size of ideal female-body norm. At the same time, these positive main effects were mostly due to the gains in body satisfaction and the size of ideal female-body norm by women whose body satisfaction was relatively undamaged to begin with. For women who were already suffering from low body satisfaction, the educational messages interacted with the predisposition to further deteriorate body satisfaction and the norm of ideal female body.

Although exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and principal components analysis (PCA) are different techniques, PCA is often employed incorrectly to reveal latent constructs (i.e., factors) of observed variables, which is the purpose of EFA. PCA is more appropriate for reducing measured variables into a smaller set of variables (i.e., components) by keeping as much variance as possible out of the total variance in the measured variables. Furthermore, the popular use of varimax rotation raises some concerns about the relationships among the factors that researchers claim to discover.

Park,HS,,"A primary focus of research in the area of deceptive communication has been on people's ability to detect deception. The premise of the current paper is that participants in previous deception detection experiments may not have had access to the types of information people most often use to detect real-life lies. Further, deception detection experiments require that people make immediate judgements, although lie detection may occur over much longer spans of time. To test these speculations, respondents (N = 202) were asked to recall an instance in which they had detected that another person had lied to them. They then answered open-ended questions concerning what the lie was about, who lied to them, and how they discovered the lie. The results suggest people most often rely on information from third parties and physical evidence when detecting lies, and that the detection of a lie is often a process that takes days, weeks, months, or longer.

Store-specific factors and trading area demographics also affect the effectiveness of store flyers.

Such redefinition entails changes in the rationale of media corporations and has turned out to be central for public service broadcasting (PSB). Yet relatively little work has focused on the implications of convergence for these particular broadcasting organizations at the newsroom level. As a contribution to filling this gap, this article reports on case study research conducted inside the main Scottish public broadcaster, BBC Scotland. Based upon in-house documents and semi-structured interviews, the research findings describe what is happening inside this major news centre and in what way convergence is shaped and embedded within this organization, in terms of news production and journalistic practices. These findings are put into perspective with regard to previous studies, as well as with contextual issues, such as the reinvention of the PSB model in the 21st century, with special mention made of the BBC, and the specific Scottish politico-communicative scenario.","| Univ Basque Country, Leioa 48940, Spain (1)",News production in the 'post-broadcasting' era: BBC Scotland's move towards convergence,"Larrondo, Ainara (1)","BBC Scotland,broadcasting,convergence,newsrooms,PSB",14-Oct,2014,MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY,WOS:000343768800003,TRUE,411,,22.42,0,0,0,0,72.73,"Univ Basque Country, Leioa 48940, Spain",,,1

Digitisation and convergence have usually been presented as an opportunity to reinvent public service broadcasting into public service media, by producing and delivering (news) content across traditional radio, television and new online platforms. While investment in digital facilities has set the basis for a more integrated operation amongst the different news media outlets, finding a workable template to implement professional cross-media practices has been more complex than expected. With the aim of exploring key challenges of convergence affecting public service broadcasting newsrooms, this article presents a multiple-case study that investigates the current convergence processes of five European mid-sized public broadcasting corporations-the United Kingdom's BBC Scotland, Spain's CCMA and EITB, Norway's NRK and Flemish-Belgian VRT. Combining an array of qualitative methods, the study focuses on specific convergence parameters, including newsrooms' physical structure and management, cross-media production routines and workflows, degree of multi-skilling in journalists, professional identities, and attitudes towards convergence. Findings show that public broadcasters tend to follow a similar pattern in basic aspects, like grouping radio, television and online newsrooms together in the same physical space, even if this model has different outcomes in terms of cooperation across media and journalists' involvement.","| Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Commun, Dept Journalism 2, Leioa, Spain (1) | Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Informat & Commun Sci, Brussels, Belgium (2) | Volda Univ Coll, Dept Media & Commun Technol, Volda, Norway (3) | Univ Ramon Llull, Sch Commun Blanquerna, Barcelona, Spain (4) | Univ Antwerp, Dept Commun Studies, Antwerp, Belgium (5)",A comparative study on European public service broadcasting organisations,"rondo, Ainara (1)| Domingo, David (2)| Erdal, Ivar John (3)| Masip, Pere (4)| Van den Bulck, Hilde (5)","European public service broadcasting,journalistic practice,media convergence,multi-skilling,newsroom culture",2016,2016,JOURNALISM STUDIES,WOS:000374963500002,FALSE,401,corrected,22.42,0,0,0,0,72.73,"Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Commun, Dept Journalism 2, Leioa, Spain",,,1

The overarching philosophy of community radio, acknowledged worldwide, is that it is a tool for social justice and a platform for community voices. Community radio seeks to counter the hegemony of the mainstream media and move away from the commerce-driven negative tendencies of media and journalism such as sensationalism, tabloidization, celebrity-worship, the unrestrained use of hidden cameras and paid news. Ordinary people, through participation in management, content production and organization, produce information relevant to them, choose their own stories, express their voice and define their identity. As India witnesses an endeavour to erect a nationwide network of thousands of autonomous, locally orientated community radio stations, it becomes necessary to build a set of codes of practice for this third tier of broadcasting so that it does not become a clone of mainstream media. This paper looks at some of these principles that the community radio sector in India must hold as sacred in order to strengthen civil society, journalism practices and democracy in India.","| Univ Hyderabad, Dept Commun, Hyderabad 500134, Andhra Pradesh, India (1)","Our Media, Our Principles Building codes of practice for community radio in India","Malik, Kanchan K.

Sources of discontent were found in: commodification of local civic nets, a prevalent middle-brow approach to web page design, the influence of 'cultural intermediaries' in and on publicly funded telematics and multimedia software development agencies, the impact of an entrepreneurial ethos in local authority policy formation, and pedagogic and patronizing attitudes towards local communities on the part of local area net development agencies. The article argues that, alongside structural corporate ICT power and the technological and scientific ICT R&D professions, these problems have a telling impact on the nature of civic and community net development. As well as criticism of the prevailing nature of city nets, the article more positively prompts a call to local authorities to adopt a form of 'critical regionalism' in order to put the control of civic nets back with the communities they are supposed primarily to be aimed at. This means empowering community ICT nodes, involving them directly in the development process, and moderating the impact of corporate ICT and cultural intermediaries within publicly funded ICT agencies.

The focus is on situations when speakers go on to explicate the referent in the transition space, after bringing the turn constructional unit to a possible completion. Depending on the grammatical affordances of the language, rendering a tacit reference explicit may either expose or mask this operation. Focusing on the latter, we show that the grammars of Russian and Brazilian Portuguese (and, to a lesser extent, English) enable speakers of these languages to explicate referents by extending a possibly complete turn constructional unit with a grammatically fitted increment and, thereby, embed this remedial operation into the progressive construction of the turn without engaging repair machinery. We discuss how tacit referring and flexible word order can enable speakers to carry out this repair-like operation in a covert or embedded fashion, and we examine some interactional functions of this referent-explicating operation.","| Rutgers State Univ, Dept Commun, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA (1) | Univ York, Dept Sociol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England (2)",Grammatical Flexibility as a Resource in Explicating Referents,"Bolden, Galina B.

Recommending treatment in chronic psychiatric care is a complex course of action that involves building a case for a treatment recommendation, eliciting an acceptance of the proposal, checking medical records, and detailing an implementation plan. This organization allows the participants to manage the complexities of making and implementing treatment decisions in this setting, such as anticipated resistance to treatment proposals, problems with adherence to a medication regimen, and the intricacy of dealing with multiple related medications whose dosages and effects need to be carefully balanced and monitored.

Bolden,Galina B.,10.1080/08351813.2012.673380,"Prior conversation analytic research has demonstrated that when, following a sequence-initiating action, a response is relevantly missing (or is forthcoming but is apparently inadequate), speakers may use a range of practices for pursuing a response (or a more adequate response). These practices-such as response prompts, preference reversals, or turn extensions-treat the missing (or inadequate) response as indicative of some problem, and they may either expose or mask the response pursuit and the problem they attempt to remediate. This article extends this prior research by showing that speakers can also use repair technology-specifically, repair of an indexical reference-as a resource for pursuing a response. It demonstrates that speakers can use repair of indexicals, particularly when no uncertainty as to the referent seems possible, in order to pursue a response while obscuring some other possible source of trouble. Initiating repair on an indexical reference in transition space claims that a missing response is due to a problem of understanding or of recognizing the reference, and by repairing it, the speaker makes available another opportunity for a response without exposing recipient disinclination as the possible source of the trouble. Likewise, repairing an indexical reference in the third turn can pursue a more adequate response, while avoiding going on record as doing so, by treating the sequence-initiating turn as the source of the trouble. We show that, by ostensibly dealing with problems of reference, repairs on indexicals manage (covertly) other more interactionally charged issues, such as upcoming disagreement or misalignment between interlocutors.","| Rutgers State Univ, Dept Commun, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA (1) | Univ Loughborough, Dept Social Sci, Loughborough, Leics, England (2)",Pursuing a Response by Repairing an Indexical Reference,"olden, Galina B.

Gan, Chin Lay ,10.1016/j.tele.2016.05.007,"Large classes are prevalent in many higher learning institutions. Drawbacks of large classes over smaller ones include the reduction of quality student-lecturer interactions, and prevalence of teacher-centered approach to learning. Given these constraints, using mobile messaging apps can ease student-lecturer interactions beyond those attainable in face to face classes. As such, the main proposition of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of using an Interactive Mobile Messaging App (IMMAP) in classrooms of higher education for supporting student-lecturer interactions. The key predictors identified from the Interactive Mobile Messaging Acceptance model were used as a guide to design and develop IMMAP. The predictors are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, self efficacy, enjoyment, system quality, information quality, and uncertainty avoidance The pretest-posttest design where participants are studied before and after the experiment concluded was used in this study. Students' perceptions of IMMAP in relation to their adoption intention were obtained using both pretest and posttest surveys. A total of 38 students from two different courses evaluated IMMAP. Findings revealed significant changes on a number of indicators. Uncertainty avoidance level decreased significantly (higher positive score) from pretest to posttest, while system quality increased. In terms of enjoyment, a significant decrease was observed from pretest to posttest. Adoption intention of IMMAP saw a significant increase. The findings reflect students' readiness to use IMMAP in the classrooms, to interact with their lecturers. Therefore, investing in the development of mobile messaging apps has the potential to improve the quality of student-lecturer interactions in the classroonis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The 1992 Eurobarometer has been the preferred source of data for analysis, and a number of suggestive conclusions regarding the extent and nature of the links between knowledge and attitudes have been proposed. Summated scales were built through principal component analysis of the attitudinal items and reliability analysis, but little attention has been paid to the content of the attitudinal items and to the metric and conceptual weaknesses of the scales. A more parsimonious revision of the data, carried out here, shows that the measures used are fuzzy and, as a consequence, the empirical support for some published results is very limited.

In the last couple of years, they have begun to interact with radio in theatres, cinemas and assorted make-shift gig venues, via mobile apps and social media platforms, and in the form of live performances, online videos, maps, tweets, blogs, forums, essays, photographs and interactive websites. Radio, like every other medium, is experimenting with ever more complex cross-media practices. These kinds of activities have been analysed at length with regard to commercial film, television and gaming, but much less is understood about radio-born approaches to transmedia content.

Sanz, Esteve ,10.1177/1461444813481198,"More than any other form of online activity, the practices of online information search have been overwhelmingly associated with their straightforward utility and with the potential alterations in the socio-economic structure that the access to this information, or lack thereof, entails. However, even when afforded such an apparently instrumental role, several important elements of the Internet are based on, and oriented towards, culture, identity and collectivity, and relate to a symbolically un-fragmented system that remains largely unconscious. In this paper we appropriate the concept of ontological security to explore the autonomy of the cultural dimension of online search, which has gone largely unanalysed in the literature. Ontological security is the unconscious sense that individuals have about the continuity and order in events related to their lives. At the collective level, it relates to the stability of the symbolic structures of society, which are both inclusive and exclusionary. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative empirical exercises, we show that search engines (1) construct ontological meaning as much as they provide utility, (2) relate to unconscious individuation even more strongly than rational instrumentality and (3) help in dealing with existential questions about the informational chaos of reality generated during the realization of global events. Even in the seemingly individualistic information society, search brings a clearer sense of the position of the subject in relation to the collectivity.","| Commiss European Communities, E-41092 Seville, Spain (1) | Commiss European Communities, IPTS, Joint Res Ctr, E-41092 Seville, Spain (2)","Your search - 'Ontological Security' - matched 111,000 documents: An empirical substantiation of the cultural dimension of online search","Sanz, Esteve (1)| Stancik, Juraj (2)","Cultural analysis,search engines,ontology",14-Mar,2014,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,WOS:000331464000005,TRUE,975,,20.09,2.82,2.44,0,0.7,73.96,"Commiss European Communities, E-41092 Seville, Spain",,,1

Results of a mixed model ANOVA revealed a significant 2-way interaction effect in a negative direction regarding communicative satisfaction for long-term married couples after a parent has moved into the adult-child home with no other substantial or significant findings. An analysis of the means indicated that the interaction effect is a function of the fact that having a parent present slightly decreases marital satisfaction, whereas when the parent is not present satisfaction increases.

Abe, M ,,"A fundamental challenge to media planners in using television advertising is to choose a daypart (time of day) combination that will achieve efficient delivery of an audience. The author addresses audience accumulation by daypart allocation with a household-level exposure model using viewing records from single-source data. By retaining the behavioral assumption of a popular beta binomial distribution model, exposure by each household within each daypart during each week is assumed to follow a binomial process with a distinct exposure probability that is inferred from the household's past exposure history. The model captures exposure heterogeneity nonparametrically by household-specific exposure probabilities rather than fitting a parametric beta function and automatically accounts for audience duplication across dayparts. This approach is made possible by the availability of large-scale household-level exposure records obtained from audimeters and the increasing computation power of personal computers. An example of spot allocation to dayparts shows hour media planners can use the model to obtain insights into audience accumulation.",,Audience accumulation by television daypart allocation based on household-level viewing data,"Abe, M (1)",,WIN 1996,1996,JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING,WOS:A1996WJ43500003,TRUE,825,,18.75,4.9,63.17,1.94,8.65,2.59,Missing,,,1

Structural equation modeling indicates that network characteristics had mixed effects.

Therefore, we aimed to identify the primary motivations of emerging adults to use Tinder. The study was conducted among Dutch 18-30 year old emerging adults who completed an online survey. Over half of the sample were current or former Tinder users (n = 163). An exploratory factor analysis, using a parallel analysis approach, uncovered six motivations to use Tinder: Love, Casual Sex, Ease of Communication, Self-Worth Validation, Thrill of Excitement, and Trendiness. In contrast to previously suggested, the Love motivation appeared to be a stronger motivation to use Tinder than the Casual Sex motivation. In line with literature on online dating, men were more likely to report a Casual Sex motivation for using Tinder than women. In addition, men more frequently reported Ease of Communication and Thrill of Excitement motives. With regard to age, the motivation Love, Casual Sex and Ease of Communication were positively related to age. Finally, Tinder motivations were meaningfully related to offline encounters with Tinder matches. In sum, the study showed that emerging adults have six primary motivations to use Tinder and that these motivations differ according to one's age and gender. Tinder should not be seen as merely a fun, hookup app without any strings attached, but as a new way for emerging adults to initiate committed romantic relationships.

Although some say that fitspiration inspires women towards an empowered body image, others argue that fitspirational social media use may negatively influence women's body image. To address these concerns, the current study (359 women; ages 18-28 years) investigated how exposure to four types of fitspirational social media messages related to three indicators of body image: body dissatisfaction, compulsive exercise, and situated optimism related to body goals. Moreover, we investigated the role of two individual difference variables in predicting women's exposure to fitspirational messages and moderating the relationships between exposure and indicators of body image: thin-ideal internalization and fit-ideal internalization. Overall, the study provides support for both positive and negative correlates of fitspirational social media use. In addition, the findings provide initial evidence that individual difference variables differentially predict exposure to certain types of fitspirational content and moderate the relationship between fitspirational social media and body image related variables.

Second, in SNS with a low level of activity, there is also the issue of whether the data are sufficient for analysis. Third, the validity of the postings by members of SNS should be considered, as members of SNS may not be truthful in their responses.

Such a framework is particularly required for media policy studies, since media companies not only represent the regulated parties, but also control the avenues of policy communication.

The major challenges described by the journalists and editors were cross-media ownership, which fosters a political economy focused on revenue generation rather than journalism for public good; problems with the publication of inaccurate information, which are now precipitated by the omnipresence of social media; and a culture of democratic deficit where journalists find it increasingly difficult to practice journalism safely and to report about poverty, corruption, crime, environment, caste, and gender. The specific knowledge systems from Sen's capabilities approach suggested for integration are the study and coverage of injustices in a democratic society; the focus on whether people have flourishing lives that give them the opportunities, freedoms, and choices they need; and economic and political freedoms that give journalists an understanding and appreciation for reporting on inequality and strengthening democratic institutions.","| SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Dept Commun Studies, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA (1) | Univ Hyderabad, Sarojini Naidu Sch Arts & Commun, Dept Commun, Hyderabad, India (2)",CONVERSING ETHICS IN INDIA'S NEWS MEDIA: A capabilities approach to journalism ethics education and training,"Rao, Shakuntala (1)| Malik, Kanchan K.

Furthermore, the broader narrative of rejection of evolution in Europe, for some Muslims, may be bound up in reactions to the secular culture and in the formation of their own minority religious identity.

The findings seem to suggest that campaigners should make more efforts to incorporate primary social influences to prevent adolescent smoking.

This study's purpose is to identify the factors associated with and processes through which Korean adults intend to view health TV programs. The comprehensive model of information seeking (CMIS) was tested using structural equation modeling that was fitted with survey data from a nationally representative sample of 1,020 South Korean adults. Results indicate that the demographic antecedents of being female and older adult and the psychological antecedents of being health conscious and health literate significantly predicted the degree to which people would perceive health TV programs to be useful. Among the information carrier factors of health TV programs, utility was directly related to intention to view, while trust in health information on TV was only indirectly related to intention to view. For theoretical implications, we suggest further conceptual and operational refinement of CMIS. For practical implications, we highlight the importance of motivational and utility factors in predicting people's intention to view health TV programs. Finally, this study stresses the importance of TV as a viable health information provider that can reduce health information gaps and help people (particularly older adults, the poor, and the less educated) to improve their health knowledge and health behaviors.","| Hanyang Univ, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Ansan, South Korea (1) | Korea Univ SSK IoT Forum, Seoul, South Korea (2)",Intention to View Health TV Programs in South Korea: An Application of the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking,"aek, Hye-Jin (1)| Choi, Mideum (2)| Hove, Thomas (3)","health TV programs,health media use,comprehensive model of information seeking,South Korea",17-Jun,2017,JOURNALISM & MASS COMMUNICATION QUARTERLY,WOS:000403493400007,FALSE,1067,corrected,16.65,1.6,78.81,0,2.22,0,"Hanyang Univ, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Ansan, South Korea",,,1

Two (pilot and main) experimental studies explore anchoring effects on audience response to food advertising both directly and moderated by cognitive, motivational, and message factors. The pilot study finds that food product ads employing nutrition claims with an anchor rather than without an anchor generate two results: First, participants perceive the product to have lower fat/lower calorie contents (anchoring hypothesis); second, they prefer the messages with an anchor over those without an anchor. The main study reports that when anchoring is successfully evoked, it produces favorable attitudes toward the ad, favorable attitudes toward the brand, and purchase intentionbut only when moderated by health orientation, claim believability, and nutrition knowledge.

Based on a cognitive response approach, viewer comments are classified and coded as message-oriented thought, video feature-relevant thought, and audience-generated thought. The three mixed logit models indicate that videos with a greater number of viewers consistently increased the odds of favorable viewer responses, while those presenting humor appeals decreased the odds of favorable message-oriented and audience-generated thoughts. Some significant interaction effects show that videos produced by laypeople may hinder favorable viewer responses, while a greater number of viewer comments can work jointly with videos presenting threat appeals to predict favorable viewer responses.

Accordingly, this study empirically tests the degree to which the persuasive impact of a video differs depending on whether the producer is a layperson or an expert. We draw theoretical rationales from several areas to compare the impact of a perceivably similar producer and an expert producer on attitudes towards video, issue importance and behavioural intention.

The spaces from which television has been taken seriously as a topic of investigation have enabled a neglect of empirical and theoretical research that genuinely engages with the ways in which television might be understood as variously surviving, growing, innovating and even leading the current and future global media landscapes. The paper offers two ways in which television scholars might productively re-locate their spheres of concentration to understand the diversity of television worlds today: 1) empirically, it considers the case of the Philippines where broadcast television is successful in ways that could only be dreamed of by television executives in the so-called 'world centres' of the global entertainment industry. 2) theoretically, the paper refers to complementary attempts in sociology, literary and cultural studies to offer alternatives to Europe and North America from which scholars might locate the vanguard for modernity, globalization and innovation. It is by engaging with both of these strands in concert-empirically investigating television beyond the 'usual places' in such a way that responds to the call of cultural theorists to question our very assumptions about where television studies' 'usual places' should be, that more nuanced understandings, and fewer premature declarations, might be made about what television is, and where it is going.","| Western Sydney Univ, Sch Humanities & Commun Arts, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia (1)",Re-Locating the Spaces of Television Studies,"Pertierra, Anna Cristina (1)","entertainment television,television studies,Philippines,social media",2016,2016,MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION,WOS:000408563400004,TRUE,210,,16.52,0,17.39,0,0,65.22,"Western Sydney Univ, Sch Humanities & Commun Arts, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",,,1

Sen, KC ,,"A study of advertising expenditures for a period of six years of about twenty brands of carbonated soft drinks shows that both demand and supply side factors affect advertising intensity. The main demand side influence is the need to advertise more for the new subcategory of diet brands. Brand market share has a negative impact on advertising intensity because of threshold effects and accumulated market goodwill.

CoAP is specifically intended to work well with low complexity sensors that have limited access to computational resources. And because it lacks the overhead of other more sophisticated transport protocols, it is suitable for high packet loss wireless networks. Relying on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), CoAP introduces, among other things, confirmable and non-confirmable message types, depending on the nature of the source data. This paper presents a novel analytical model that can relate the application to network packet loss and be used to estimate the effect of lossy wireless channels in CoAP scenarios.

Herrero,Rocio,10.1089/cyber.2014.0052,"One of the most important aspects of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is its impact on quality of life, increasing negative emotions and dysfunctional coping strategies. One of these strategies is to avoid activities, especially meaningful activities, which reduces positive reinforcement. Commencing significant daily activities could enable chronic patients to experience a more fulfilling life. However, the main difficulty found in FMS patients is their willingness to start those activities. Promoting positive emotions could enhance activity management. The aim of this paper is to present a description of a system along with data regarding the acceptability, satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy of a virtual reality (VR) environment for the promotion of positive emotions. The VR environment was especially designed for chronic pain patients. Results showed significant increases in general mood state, positive emotions, motivation, and self-efficacy. These preliminary findings show the potential of VR as an adjunct to the psychological treatment of such an important health problem as chronic pain.","| Univ Jaume 1, Dept Basic & Clin Psychol & Psychobiol, Castellon de La Plana 46022, Spain (1) | Hosp Clin Univ Santiago de Compostela Choupana, Ciber Fisiopatol Obesidad & Nutr CIBEROBN, Santiago De Compostela, Spain (2)","Virtual Reality for the Induction of Positive Emotions in the Treatment of Fibromyalgia: A Pilot Study over Acceptability, Satisfaction, and the Effect of Virtual Reality on Mood","rero, Rocio (1)| Garcia-Palacios, Azucena (2)| Castilla, Diana (3)| Molinari, Guadalupe (4)| Botella, Cristina (5)",,14-Jun,2014,CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,WOS:000337184600010,FALSE,807,corrected,16.1,0,8.05,0,1.1,74.57,"Univ Jaume 1, Dept Basic & Clin Psychol & Psychobiol, Castellon de La Plana 46022, Spain",,,1

In this article, we wish to explore media discourses in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attack in three European countries - Spain, Norway and the United Kingdom. In particular, we investigate if and how journalism performed their role as 'vital centre' in the 'civil sphere'. We find that the patterns of in-group and out-group were carefully constructed to avoid polarization between 'ordinary' Muslims and the West in most newspapers.

The article explores the media discourse on the femicide crisis in Argentina in June 2015 constructed in international and national news outlets and analyses interviews with journalists and activists. In the years prior to the emergence of the #NotOneLess movement, discourse on human rights in Argentina had become polarized owing to Kirchnerism's monopolization and instrumentalization of it, which caused it to disappear from many sectors of Argentine society.

This study conducts an investigation of Twitter's use as a campaign tool during the 2014 Indian general elections, which was the country's first experiment with using social media for political campaigning. We present a multi-level manual and computer-aided analysis of 98,363 tweets posted by eleven political parties during the two-month run up to the elections, to present the topical, functional and interaction strategies of their Twitter campaigns. This analysis is complemented by a macro analysis of electoral outcomes' relationship with first-time voter population and internet accessibility information at the state level. Our findings suggest that the new-and-upcoming parties used Twitter for self-promotion and media validation, while established parties used it to supplement their offline strategies.

We adopted an original research design intending Facebook as a natural environment where investigating the interaction between social media users and populist and non-populist parties. Our case selection considers three countries falling into the pluralist polarized media system: France, Italy, and Spain. A human content analysis was carried out on a sample of 2,235 Facebook posts published during thirty days in 2016 by the four main parties/leaders in each country. An original algorithm allowed to identify the gender of users liking each message. We tested whether men tend more to provide likes to messages posted by populist parties, messages published by radical populists, messages containing populist contents, and different components of populist messages. Findings confirm the existence of a gender-oriented reaction to populism: Men tend to support populist actors and parties on Facebook more than women do, by providing likes to their content. Yet the difference in gender gap between radical and moderate parties is not significant. We also found that the antielite component of populist discourse obtains more likes by male Facebook users. This pattern is common for both populist and non-populist parties.","| Univ Turin, Dept Cultures Polit & Soc, Lungo Dora 100-A, I-10153 Turin, Italy (1) | Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy (2)","Populism and the Gender Gap: Comparing Digital Engagement with Populist and Non-populist Facebook Pages in France, Italy, and Spain","bba, Giuliano (1)| Cremonesi, Cristina (2)| Mancosu, Moreno (3)| Seddone, Antonella (4)","digital engagement,gender gap,Mediterranean model,populism,social media",18-Oct,2018,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS,WOS:000444491900003,FALSE,446,corrected,14.34,0,79.78,0,2.94,1.84,"Univ Turin, Dept Cultures Polit & Soc, Lungo Dora 100-A, I-10153 Turin, Italy",,,1

On the basis of semi-structured interviews with 30 high school students who emigrated from Mexico to the United States, we identified several stressors from being undocumented, including having limited opportunities, fear of deportation, and exposure to negative reminders of their undocumented status. To manage such stressors, students utilized individual coping strategies (e.g. diversion, reframing, normalizing). In addition, the families of undocumented youth employed various coping strategies to help buffer their children against stressors from being undocumented (e.g. protecting the family unit, positive future, emotional support, limited communication). From our findings, we developed a preliminary model that describes the stress and coping of the undocumented youth in this study, which can extend past theorizing on resilience and thriving, as well as inform the design of community-based programs and policies for undocumented youth and their family.","| Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA (1) | Coll New Jersey, Dept Commun Studies, Ewing Township, NJ USA (2)",Identifying individual- and family-level coping strategies as sources of resilience and thriving for undocumented youth of Mexican origin,"am, Jennifer A.

Drawing on both a thematic analysis of the Manila-centric Philippine entertainment media and six focus group discussions with the city's local Filipinos, I reveal that this instance of mediation is entangled with the broader discourses of the Philippine postcolonial nationalist project. For one, the mediation of multiculturalism in Manila tends to symbolically marginalize the city's Indians and Koreans and, in so doing, reinforces existing negative discourses about them. I contend that this is linked to the locals' preoccupation with establishing a unifying cultural identity that tends to make them elide the issue of their own internal cultural diversity, as well as of the increasing diasporic population of the city. Second, the said mediation also tends to valorize the lighter-skinned Koreans over the darker-skinned Indians. I posit that this is related to how the locals' discourse of cultural homogeneity has resulted in their continued reluctance to publicly discuss the persistence of their unspoken skin-tone-based racial hierarchy not only of themselves, but also of their cultural others.","| Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England (1)","Multicultural mediations, developing world realities: Indians, Koreans and Manila's entertainment media","Cabanes, Jason Vincent Aquino (1)","cultural identity,developing world city,diaspora,entertainment media,media representation,mediation,public talk",14-Jul,2014,MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY,WOS:000339054300005,TRUE,1980,,13.33,0,45.93,0,0,36.3,"Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",,,1

After initially indicating that sanctioning MMA was unimportant, the Ontario government shifted its policy and announced it would sanction professional MMA events. A content analysis was conducted on newsprint articles published between 2009 and 2010 that were related to the sanctioning of MMA events in Ontario. After removing syndicated reports, 18 newsprint articles derived from six major Canadian dailies served as the focus for this study. Using open and axial coding techniques, these articles identified that the media produced two frames for the discourse related to the sanctioning of MMA (i.e., legal/ethical and economic), which changed throughout the discourse.

This issue was examined in a field study involving over 300 baseball fans attending minor league games during the summer season. Signal detection analyses reveal that, even among such sports fans, the ability to correctly discriminate actual official sponsors of the home team from matched foils, although above chance, was rather poor. Consistent with recent laboratory findings, sponsor identification responses were further found to be heavily influenced by the mere plausibility of the brand as a potential sponsor. This plausibility effect was equally pronounced for actual sponsors and for foils. The phenomenon seems to be driven by a reliance on plausibility-based inferences that was widespread across respondents (as opposed to limited to a few). These plausibility-based inferences, whether correct or incorrect, can have as much influence on attributions of sponsorship as actual exposure to genuine sponsorship information.

Therefore, retaining existing consumers has been a challenging task for smartphone manufacturer brands. Given the status quo in smartphone industry and deficiencies in smartphone research, this study proposes a model that integrates Expectation Confirmation Model and brand attachment to shed light on smartphone repurchase decision making process. Besides, gender differences are also accounted for in the model. This study employs a two-staged approach, namely PLS-ANN, in analysing the data collected from 510 existing smartphone owners. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was firstly engaged, and followed by artificial neural network analysis. Besides, a non-parametric partial least squares multi-group analysis has also been conducted to discover gender differences in such decision making process. The results suggest that brand attachment is the most influential and relevant driver of consumers' intention to repurchase smartphones from current brand (measured by continuance intention). Moreover, male consumers are more sensitive to the influence of brand attachment in developing their satisfaction and continuance intention, while female consumers are relying more on perceived usefulness. Interestingly, perceived usefulness does not significantly influence male consumers in continuance intention development. Practical and theoretical implications are subsequently offered.

It argues in favor of how mobile phones could empower socio-economically marginalized young people to overcome their marginality by examining its use within the broader socio-cultural, economic and political contexts. Drawing on the information and communication capabilities of mobile phones, this paper uses an ethnographic data and a synthesized empowerment framework to analyze the relationship between mobile phone usage and empowerment of marginalized young people in Sierra Leone. In doing so, the paper focuses on the socio-culture, political and economic uses of mobile phones. The focus on these uses is based on the argument that for mobile phones to empower marginalized young people their uses should facilitate economic, political and socio-cultural issues underpinning their marginality. The study results suggest that mobile phones empower marginalized young people to communicate and access vital livelihood information to articulate their everyday activities.

However, do consumers from different cultures have varying preferences for model size? To investigate the impact of using an average-sized model (versus a thin model) in apparel ads, we first conducted experiments in both an individualistic culture (i.e., United States) and a collectivistic culture in Asia (i.e., Singapore). Our findings demonstrate that U.S. women expressed increased purchase intentions upon seeing an average-sized model (versus a thin model). Their perceived user-imagery congruity (UIC) also mediates the link between model size and purchase intentions. However, Singaporean women did not differ in their responses upon seeing the ad with an average-sized model (versus a thin model).

The study perceives the many ongoing attempts of legalizing and decriminalizing cannabis for recreational use as providing a disequilibrium to the hegemonic view of the substance as a dangerous narcotic that is rightly banned, and as intensifying a hegemonic struggle over the meaning of cannabis. Swedish print news journalism about cannabis legalization in different countries and contexts is studied, using critical discourse analysis. The analysis shows that journalism allows for debate between positive and skeptic discourses about the effects of recreational cannabis consumption and its medical benefits, and that voices that argue for cannabis legalization to combat organized crime are given important framing power. This means that a measure of legitimacy is given to discourses that counter the prohibitionist hegemony in Sweden, which means that mainstream journalism in this specific case serves as an arena for challenging hegemonic values that are in crisis.","| Jonkoping Univ, Sch Educ & Commun, Jonkoping, Sweden (1)",Rifts in the Hegemony: Swedish News Journalism on Cannabis Legalization,"Abalo, Ernesto (1)","Cannabis legalization,critical theory,critical discourse analysis,hegemony,journalism,legitimation",AUG 18 2019,2019,JOURNALISM STUDIES,WOS:000474669300007,TRUE,318,,11.82,26.36,8.64,0,0,50.91,"Jonkoping Univ, Sch Educ & Commun, Jonkoping, Sweden",,,1

Compulsive usage of smartphones, however, affects the users' emotional and physical health. The objective of this study is to examine how personality characteristics are related to compulsive smartphone usage and if compulsive smartphone usage impacts users' ill being. Personality characteristics such as extraversion and conscientiousness are found to be leading to the compulsive smartphone usage, whereas neuroticism, openness to new experience, and agreeableness are found to be negatively influencing compulsive smartphone usage. Extraversion is found to have maximum influence on an individual's compulsive tendency to use smartphone, followed by conscientiousness. The findings of this study also made the authors believe that compulsive smartphone usage, affects both emotional (affecting inter-personal and family relationships) and physical (lack of quality sleep and physical discomfort) health of the smartphone users.

Uchida, R ,,"In modern society, memory is often constructed, and sometimes erased, in conformity with the political purposes of the nation-state. From this point of view many historians have analysed the construction of memory. However, cultural resources such as media and technologies support the concrete formation of memory; in other words, we can reconsider the problem of memory in the phase of social experience that is closely connected with the media, technologies and the flow of capital. It is this phase of social experience that makes possible the political projects of the nation-state. In this article, I consider the songs published in 1910 for musical education at primary school by the Ministry of Education. The song was considered to be an effective strategy for state education, because it is easier for children to learn and is internalized more directly and unconsciously through the medium of music, than literary texts such as novels, poetry, etc. In 1890, the Imperial Rescript on Education was promulgated as the fundamental principle of national education. Its main object was to build up the faithful subject of the Emperor system of Japan and musical education was also coordinated with this policy. In the society after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 discipline relaxed among the people and social disaffection increased. The Ministry of Education songs were designed as a device to reinforce moral education. However, not all of people's memory was edited and manipulated by the government. In the song 'Home' (1914), the scene took on a character of anonymity. How was this scene deeply impressed on the private feelings of individuals? At that time, due to changing social conditions, there appeared an abstract social space constructed from reproducible images and extended across national boundaries. The song 'Home' mobilized the mass public not toward specific political goals, but to experience as actual that abstract social space.","| Univ Tokyo, Dept Adv Social & Int Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1530041, Japan (1)",Memory and the transformation of social experience in modern Japan: rethinking the song 'Home',"Uchida, R (1)",,Mar-99,1999,MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY,WOS:000079160100005,TRUE,1843,,10.29,0,78.81,0,7.96,2.77,"Univ Tokyo, Dept Adv Social & Int Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1530041, Japan",,,1

These challenges may be magnified for a subpopulation of African-American and Hispanic men who have been incarcerated. A survey assessing demographics, incarceration experience, psychosocial, behavioral, and cancer health information seeking was administered to 230 previously incarcerated men aged 35years and older. Data analysis was performed to assess the association between fatalism, perceived susceptibility, and health information seeking in this population. This study revealed the following: the majority of the participants (68.7%) held the fatalistic belief: When I think of cancer, I automatically think of death. Second, the fatalistic belief, There's not much you can do to lower your chances of getting cancer, is more prevalent among those who perceived a higher risk of developing cancer. Third, older participants (those between 55 and 70years old) and widowed are less likely to think of death when they think of cancer. In addition, those who use the Internet to look for health or medical information (i.e., engaging in health information seeking) are less likely to agree with the fatalistic belief: It seems like everything causes cancer. Given the high incidence of certain cancers among African-American and Hispanic men and the vulnerability of those involved in the criminal justice system, our findings highlight the importance of understanding perceived susceptibility to cancer, fatalistic beliefs about cancer, and information seeking in formerly incarcerated men.","| Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Div Social Solut & Serv Res, 140 Old Orangeburg Rd, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA (1) | New York Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA (2) | Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA (3) | Columbia Univ, Dept Sociomed Sci, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA (4)",Fatalistic Cancer Beliefs and Information Seeking in Formerly Incarcerated African-American and Hispanic Men: Implications for Cancer Health Communication and Research,"lera, Pamela (1)| Lian, Zi (2)| Brotzman, Laura (3)| Reid, Andrea (4)",,2018,2018,HEALTH COMMUNICATION,WOS:000426919000008,FALSE,326,corrected,9.99,1.29,19.52,0,0,67.93,"Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Div Social Solut & Serv Res, 140 Old Orangeburg Rd, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA",,,1

We compare quarterly time series of the mean responses with the actual behavior of inflation and unemployment to see whether households are overly optimistic or pessimistic about the future behavior of inflation and unemployment. We find an asymmetry. Over the 21 years of our analysis, on average the public is neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic about future inflation. However, the public has been significantly too pessimistic about the future behavior of unemployment. These results have an important implication for macroeconomic policy. If politicians respond to complaints from the public about inflation and unemployment they will target policy instruments at unemployment to a greater extent than if the public was not so pessimistic about the behavior of unemployment.

The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of rumor control by investigating the factors impacting the effectiveness of countermessage exposure. A total of 164 participants were asked to judge the believability of rumor and factual tweets before and after countermessage exposure in a web-based experiment. Two forms of countermessage were compared to examine the effects of countermessages on belief change in the target tweets. One was subjective countermessages based on personal experiences, and the other was objective countermessages based on evidence. The results showed that objective countermessages reduced belief in rumor tweets, whereas subjective countermessages strengthened false beliefs. In addition, the half of the participants who were exposed to objective countermessages randomly mixed with subjective countermessages formed negative attitudes not only toward the rumor tweets but also toward the factual tweets. The results also showed gender differences in response to countermessage exposure; women tended to be more susceptible to countermessages and changed their beliefs regarding the target tweets negatively after the exposure.

The imagined interaction partners in these scenarios were described as someone possessing status either equal to or greater than the students' status. For each scenario, subjects wrote down what they thought they would say in the situation and then responded to several items about their perceptions of the message and situation. Results were strongly supportive of the theory. Both American and Japanese students produced messages exhibiting substantial equivocation, but only when in an avoidance-avoidance conflict situation. Contrary to expectations, such situations did not elicit more equivocation from Japanese students than from American students; nor did relative status affect the use of equivocation.

This is reflected in dramatic differences in participant orientations to turn construction and projection in the respective languages. Specifically, in contrast to English grammar, which massively enables early projectability of the social action that might occupy a turn, the grammatical structure of Japanese permits incremental transformability of a turn in progress and overwhelmingly results in a later arrival of the point at which the emerging shape of a turn can be known. This delayed projectability in Japanese, however, is to a large extent compensated by a potentially greater degree of certitude with which participants can localize turn endings through devices that mark possible transition-relevance places.","| Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England (1)",Turn projection in Japanese talk-in-interaction,"Tanaka, H (1)",,2000,2000,RESEARCH ON LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION,WOS:000085361400001,TRUE,191,,9.38,0,77.06,0,9.39,3.8,"Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",,,1

The psychological traits of private self-consciousness, reassurance-seeking, and information need were hypothesized to be effective in establishing consciousness of the benefits; these also had significant positive effects. In contrast, only positive feedback had a significant influence on satisfaction related to information handling skill, whereas both negative and positive feedback had significant influences on satisfaction related to information handling skill. This suggests that communication with readers who gave positive feedback strongly encouraged blog authors to continue writing. Similarities and differences between the two models and recommendations for further theoretical development are discussed.","| Kobe Gakuin Univ, Dept Psychol, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan (1) | Senshu Univ, Sch Network & Informat, Tokyo, Japan (2)",Psychological and Social Influences on Blog Writing: An Online Survey of Blog Authors in Japan,"Miura, Asako (1)| Yamashita, Kiyomi (2)",,7-Jul,2007,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,WOS:000444387200015,TRUE,24,,8.5,0,75.47,0,9.78,5.94,"Kobe Gakuin Univ, Dept Psychol, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",,,1
Soriano, Cheryll Ruth ,10.1016/j.tele.2011.04.004,"The online communicative environment is expected to revolutionize political discourse as it expands to cover underrepresented groups and ideas. In this platform, marginalized groups such as indigenous communities from the developing world can articulate claims, strategically mobilize and participate in the forms of meaning-making that constitute them. However, there is skepticism on the actual value of online spaces in effecting agency in an internet-mediated environment. Using James Scott's notion of 'hidden transcripts' and Andrew Feenberg's 'democratic rationalization of technology', the paper explores strategic approaches and historical, social, and political conditions embedded in the construction, negotiation, and transformation of indigenous online activist media. In-depth interviews and textual analysis of online spaces were conducted to understand the experiences and online articulations of two indigenous groups based in the Philippines, Tebtebba and Cordillera People's Alliance with specific attention to the: (a) forms and characteristics of online struggles, (b) dynamics and strategies behind the production and distribution of online dissent, (c) process of negotiation of technological use, and (d) perceived implications of online mediations on group identity, culture and struggle. Problematizing the complex interaction of technology and indigenous identity, the paper finds that indigenous activists' online media engagement constitutes a sustained balancing act between accommodation and resistance and online spaces are used creatively with reflection on the dangers and benefits of online spaces to the organization and the struggle.

Adachi, Paul J. C. ,10.1037/ppm0000042,"The majority of research on video games has focused on negative outcomes such as aggression, at the expense of research on positive outcomes. Recently, however, research on the link between video game play and positive outcomes has been increasing. Importantly, a potential positive outcome of sports video game play among adolescents that has been unexplored is greater involvement in real-life sports. Given that sports attrition increases during adolescence, it is critical to identify predictors of increased involvement in sports during this developmental period. In the present study, we examined this question by testing the bidirectional association between sports video game play and involvement in sports with 1492 adolescents over 4 years. In addition, we investigated whether self-esteem was an underlying mechanism of the predictive effect of sports video game play on involvement in sports. The results indicated a bidirectional association between sports video game play and involvement in sports, in that sports video game play predicted greater involvement in sports over time, and that adolescents who played sports more frequently were more likely to play sports video games than adolescents who played sports less frequently. In addition, we found evidence that self-esteem may be an underlying mechanism of the predictive effect of sports video game play on involvement in sports. These novel findings suggest that sports video games may be an effective tool to promote self-esteem as well as participation in sports among adolescents.","| Brock Univ, Dept Psychol, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada (1)","From the Couch to the Sports Field: The Longitudinal Associations Between Sports Video Game Play, Self-Esteem, and Involvement in Sports","Adachi, Paul J.

Although some scholars assume that cabinet reshuffles help prime ministers increase their government's popularity, this assumption has not been tested formally because of the endogeneity problem. In Japan, polling firms sometimes provide respondents with cues about a reshuffle when asking about cabinet approval following reshuffles, while others do not. I utilized this convention in the Japanese media to test the assumption that reshuffles increase cabinet approval ratings. Applying a dynamic linear model to pooled poll data from 2001 to 2015, I achieved high internal, external, and ecological validity. The analyses show that cues about reshuffles increase cabinet approval ratings by 2.4 percentage points on average, and the credible interval of the effect does not include zero.

Louie, TA ,,"Two studies address how companies should react when celebrity endorsers with whom they wish to associate are blameless or blameworthy for causing negative events (e.g., accidents). Research findings on stigmas suggest a linear endorser blame-company evaluation relationship, such that companies should associate (disassociate) with endorsers who have low (high) levels of blame for negative events. In contrast, research findings on defensive distortions suggest a nonmonotonic blame-evaluation relationship: Owing to the tendency to downgrade low blame persons so that they seem deserving of bad fate, companies benefit from associating with moderate, rather than low or high, blame celebrities. The current research suggests that the stage of the company-endorser relationship influences the pattern of findings and the type of endorser decisions companies should make. In Study 1 (n=121), consistent with stigma research, companies fared better when dismissing existing endorsers with high blame and keeping those with low blame.

Social movement scholars advocate that technology is becoming an integral component of the social movement repertoire, and building on their work, Internet scholars have examined the evolving nature of movement organizations and formal networks. Adopting resource mobilization and social network theories as the conceptual framework, this study examines political bloggers' social networks. Through 41 in-depth interviews and 76 survey responses, we collected data on political bloggers' activism participation and their organizational affiliations. Social networking patterns are linked to different organizational affiliation types - membership with formal organizations rooted in the offline context; membership with issue-based online organizations which assume a temporal nature and non-membership. Focusing on the dialectics between offline and online, permanence and temporality, the study showed that activists who belonged to offline-based organizations experienced greater social influence and collectiveness with one another. However, activist bloggers who belonged to online-based groups shared strong ties and sustained communication even after a campaign ended. More significantly, the findings show that online movement groups, although temporal in nature, foster what Sunstein [(2009). Republic.com 2.0 (pp. 19-45).

Our methodological test case is thus to establish from empirical evidence layers embedded in the fundaments of a particular journalism culture, recognizing influences of both endogenous and foreign cultures accumulated throughout the modernization process. These layers hence embrace a spectrum that links the endogenous cultural foundations of writing and reading (in this case those nurtured in Japan) with the surface level layers that are constituted by universalistic' (or global) standards of journalism.

The results indicate that pirated Japanese animation is widely viewed via the Internet by adolescents; on the other hand, domestic animation is popular only among children. Preferences for domestic animation correlate positively with age and patriotism but negatively with Internet use, while preferences for Japanese animation correlate negatively with age and patriotism but positively with Internet use. These results show that nationalistic sentiments are associated with preferences for either domestic or foreign animation programmes.

Similar to a face-to-face situation, conflict is also seen in these online relationships. Early theories suggested that computer-mediated communication (CMC) tends to increase conflicts because of the lack of social-context cues, and CMC is not rich enough to manage conflict. As CMC has become part of our daily life, we often face conflict online, and thus we need to understand how people manage conflict online. This study explored how online users manage interpersonal conflict. Self-report survey data from 159 university students were analyzed to examine their conflict-management styles in association with the perceived closeness of the online relationship and a future intention toward the relationship.

This study analyses the impact of Internet use on this imbalance and investigates whether the disparity remains intact in the Digital Age. Accessibility to the Internet is somewhat agnostic to one's education and may be a quick and cost-effective tool to affect the political process. This study employs the concept of online political efficacy (OPE), which is likely to impact online political participation (OPP), to test whether Internet use provokes a sense of political effectiveness in the less educated to a greater extent than those more educated. Internet Service Types, particularly social media, were found to be positively associated with OPE to a much greater extent among the less educated. These findings indicate that, as a result of an enhanced positive perception of the Internet from using the Internet Service Types, the less educated are likely to feel empowered to affect the political process to a greater degree than the educated.

Sakamoto, K ,,"This article examines the transgressive function of some Japanese women's magazines in the 1970s. It traces changes in the lives of Japanese women by focusing on the emergence of three new magazines that targeted young women from the late teens to the early 20s. It examines the contents of two magazines, An'an and Nan'no, launched at the beginning of the 1970s, which showed their readers how to get independent time and space away from the surveillance of parents. In 1977 another magazine, More, was launched, targeting readers in their 20s and 30s who were brought up reading An'an and Non'no. More shows the strong influence of feminism, and encouraged its readers to escape from the traditional women's life which was centred on marriage, husband and children. This article argues that the three magazines reflected the changes of Japanese women and reinforced those changes by providing knowledge, support for new identities and an imaginary community for readers. In this respect: it breaks with earlier feminist readings of girls' magazines which focused on their ideological function of reproducing patriarchy.","| Ochanomizu Univ, Fac Letters & Educ, Dept Sociol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1680082, Japan (1)",Reading Japanese women's magazines: the construction of new identities in the 1970s and 1980s,"Sakamoto, K (1)",,Mar-99,1999,MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY,WOS:000079160100003,TRUE,2141,,6.53,0,78.26,0,11.6,3.43,"Ochanomizu Univ, Fac Letters & Educ, Dept Sociol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1680082, Japan",,,1

As this assertion is presently unproven, the purpose of this analysis is to estimate the long-run relationship between ICT, energy consumption, and economic growth in Japan. Using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach, we estimate two different multivariate models corresponding to the production function and the energy demand function, both including ICT investment as an explanatory variable, over the period 1980-2010. The results reveal the presence of a long-run stable relationship, not only for the production function, but also for the energy demand function. However, in the production function, the long-run coefficient estimate for ICT investment is statistically insignificant, unlike the coefficients for labor, stock, and energy. In the case of the energy demand function, the coefficients for GDP, energy price, and ICT investment are statistically significant. The results also indicate that the long-run ICT investment elasticity of energy consumption is -0.155. On this basis, we conclude that while ICT investment could ceteris paribus contribute to a moderate reduction in energy consumption, but not to an increase in GDP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous investigations of Latino heterogeneity as a catalyst for unity or division are limited to narrow issue domains and the set of elections characterized by within-group diversity. It remains unclear whether Latinos will respond cohesively to co-ethnic cues in national politics. Using data state-level Web search volumes related to Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court, we assess the extent to which Latino national origin within the states corresponds to expressed interest in her. We find the relative size of the Puerto Rican population predicts interest in Sotomayor's nomination above the positive effects predicted by panethnic Latino population. The results indicate heterogeneity in Latino political orientations and simultaneously show that differential responses to co-ethnic cues among Latinos may be reinforcing rather than oppositional.

Actual PSB policy focused predominantly on a narrowly defined 'basic cultural right' of access to broadcast media and on social equalization between urban and rural access to broadcast networks. Other values of PSB, including high-quality programming, independence and impartiality, are still marginalized.

The lack of consensus on the substance of the public interest undermines any meaningful political construction of PSB.

Raghubir, P ,,"""On July 1, 1997, Hong Kong ceased to be a British colony and became the first Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (PRC). We report the results of three field experiments conducted in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (N 1,250) from June to August 1997 that examine attitudes toward the impact of Hong Kong's transition as a function of question order and framing. We invoke two aspects of attitudes--(1) whether they are stored in a memory network, and (2) whether their validity is important to the respondent--to predict when order and framing effects are most likely to occur. Experiment 1 examines part-part order effects and reveals attitude polarization such that positive attitudes regarding the effect of the transition on the future of Hong Kong (China) become more extreme if they are elicited after similar responses regarding a related entity, China (Hong Kong). Experiment 2 focuses on part-whole order effects and finds evidence of carryover effects from responses to specific questions on subsequently posed general questions. Experiment 3 examines the effect of framing the transition issue as a """"reunification,"""" """"handover,"""" or ''takeover'' on attitudes toward the effect of Hong Kong's transition on Macau and Taiwan. The negative takeover frame elicits less favorable responses when respondents are motivated to hold attitudes perceived as valid (i.e., for attitudes toward one's own country) but not otherwise.

The focal point of the analysis is newspaper reporting of the 2003 Fukuoka family murder in Japan, in which three students from China killed a Japanese family. Close examination of two major Japanese newspapers suggests that their reporting of the Fukuoka case connects crime and a minority group in two ways. First, the newspapers frequently utilize nationality and immigration status as descriptors of the Fukuoka case suspects, and thus encourage an intuitive mental connection between foreignness and crime. Furthermore, opinion pieces and editorial articles interpret the murder in the context of immigration policies and the financial hardship often experienced by international students, suggesting that the Fukuoka case is one manifestation of international student criminality.

To date, there has been no systematic study of the relationship between broader forms of subjective citizenship such as those of interest to institutional theorists, and the patterns of cultural taste and consumption of concern to sociologists of culture. In order to fill this gap, I analyze the relationship between three different forms of subjective citizenship, national (Spain), international (European community) and postnational (world community), and the propensity to display omnivorous patterns of cultural choice and to draw symbolic boundaries through the expression of cultural dislikes. If both world citizenship and the turn toward inclusive forms of cultural taste and consumption emanate from the same global cultural logic, there should be a positive relationship between patterns of geographic identification most closely connected to the world polity and cultural omnivorousness, and a negative association between world polity identification and taste exclusiveness. Regression results support this view: in relation to subnational forms of subjective citizenship, only postnational identification is positively related to both broad consumption and less exclusive taste.

However, contemporary research on the digital divide struggles to link historical legacies of uneven development, as well as social justice strategies, with digital participation in urban spaces. By examining contemporary digital art that critiques the spatial inequalities encountered by U.S. racial minorities, this article illustrates how public intellectuals use ICTs in ways that draw upon past strategies to territorialize space for political ends. It focuses on digital pop-ups, open-air installations that cast images onto public space using projectors. Historicizing these new efforts illustrates a continuity of tactics engaged by communities of color in response to socio-spatial inequalities in the urban United States, such as the 1970s mural movement's efforts to re-politicize spaces of exclusion. While existing literature finds that digital inequality results in differential digital human capital, this research indicates that place-based claims, such as digital pop-ups, are important sites for combatting racial injustice and creating more inclusionary spaces, especially among youth adults.","| Univ Calif Los Angeles, Cesar E Chavez Dept Chicana & Chicano Studies, 7339 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA (1)","Racial projections: cyberspace, public space, and the digital divide","Carpio, Genevieve G.

Although targeted politicians have tried a number of different strategies to respond to implicit racial appeals, little is known about the effectiveness of these strategies. Using two survey experiments, we answer the following question: Does calling the appeal racial work? That is, does it neutralize the negative effects on the attacked candidate? We find mixed evidence that it does. However, offering a credible justification for the attacked behavior works more consistently. We also test whether effects vary by candidate race. The results suggest that Black candidates' rhetorical strategies are more constrained than identical White candidates', but that White Americans are more open to credible arguments and justifications than the previous literature implies.","| Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA (1)",Countering Implicit Appeals: Which Strategies Work?,"Tokeshi, Matthew (1)| Mendelberg, Tali (2)","race,opinion",OCT 2 2015,2015,POLITICAL COMMUNICATION,WOS:000362555500007,TRUE,639,,4.5,0,76.58,0,9.01,9.91,"Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,,1

It examines the uses of the Internet, social networking sites and mobile text-messaging by the radio station. Three central questions constitute the major concerns of the article: (a) To what extent do institutional and organizational contexts shape the uptake and uses of the Internet and mobile phones by radio journalists? (b) How do the uses of the Internet and mobile phones in turn influence the institutional cultures and organizational practices? (c) To what extent, if at all, does radio convergence reconfigure traditional radio to create new spaces that augment audience participation? The article argues that any meaningful critique of the technological affordances to the radio institution must critically engage with the complex questions of the dialectical relationship between technology, structure, and agency especially given the seductive myth of the so-called new media. It concludes that digital media technologies on radio are subject to organisational, institutional, and social shaping, and that questions about the emancipatory power of these technologies especially to audiences and citizens are often exaggerated because the question of power relations between actors or interests is often overlooked. The digital turn and the demotic turn on radio therefore must not be seen as synonymous with the participatory turn, especially in African countries where the regulation of corporate power in mass media is weak and where multiple forms of the digital divide that impede on consistent and meaningful use of digital media still persist.

The internet is seen as certainly enhancing the people's right to communicate, but only to a limited extent because of access disparities on the one hand, and its appropriation by liberal social movements whose configuration is elitist, on the other. I conclude by arguing that the alternative media in Zimbabwe, as reflected by Kubatana's bloggers, lack the capacity to envision alternative social and political orders outside the neoliberal framework. This, I contend, is partly because of the political economy of both blogging as a social practice and alternative media as subaltern spaces.

Drawing on Mulvey's and Butler's psychoanalytic theories, this paper shows that, early on, M is post-sexualized as she is distanced from youthful femininity and aligned with phallic masculinity. Following this, and contrary to consensus that M's domestication began in the Daniel Craig era, this paper contends that by the middle of the Pierce Brosnan era, M's power is already exposed as a facade and she consequently enters the maternal realm. Expanding on Tasker's writing on women in action films, this paper details how M's authority not only shifts entirely into the maternal sphere but is also systematically stripped until she becomes a peculiar mother-child. Finally, this paper identifies an emerging pattern within popular media of turning Ma'ams to Moms to martyrs. Evidence is taken from Dench's final Bond films and other contemporary action film series (Star Wars, The Hunger Games, and Divergent).

This article begins with the understanding that subjectivity is an intractable part of knowing (and reporting on) the world around us to build our understanding of different modes of subjectivity and how these animate journalistic practices. Taking arts reporting, specifically reviewing, as a case study, the analysis draws on interviews with 40 book reviewers who write for major American newspapers, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and prominent blogs. Findings reveal how emotions, bias, and self-interest are salient - sometimes as vice and sometimes as virtue - across the workflow of critics writing for traditional print outlets and book blogs and that these differences can be conceptualized as different epistemic styles.","| McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada (1)","Valuing subjectivity in journalism: Bias, emotions, and self-interest as tools in arts reporting","Chong, Phillipa (1)","Blogs,emotion,literary journalism,newspapers,online media,practice,subjectivity/objectivity",19-Mar,2019,JOURNALISM,WOS:000459284300004,TRUE,861,,3.2,1.72,78.89,0.1,7.3,8.79,"McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,,1

More specifically, they criticise the misguided use of focus groups to understand consumers; the fact that published research often comes too slow and too late; the non-contextual fashion in which most advertising research is conducted; the unrealistic nature of pre-campaign research; and the use of research as a rhetorical tool. In addition, they assert that the creative nature of developing advertisements is fundamentally at odds with the methodical, 'scientific' nature of research, and doubt that the two can be fully reconciled.
