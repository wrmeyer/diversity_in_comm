Wil-Cite Instructions:
======================

1) Before opening the program:
    make sure the following files are in the same folder:
        -database.csv OR complete.csv and to_code.csv
        -GUI.exe
    these files will automatically change when using the program.

2) Starting the program:
    -Run the program labeled "gui.exe."
    -Click the button labeled "initialize" in the top right corner of the program


3) Using the program

    a) Entry Boxes
        You will see two major sections of the program: the buttons and boxes on top and the browser below. On the top section of the 
        program are 3 entry boxes labeled "Name," "Institution," and "Paper Title." These boxes are automatically populated with the author's 
        name, affiliated institution at the time of publication, and the title of the paper. These three boxes can be changed to remove
        inaccuracies or abbreviations. Whatever is entered into these boxes will appear in the final database as well as change the search
        terms in the browser automation.

    b) Automating the browser
        On the left side of the program are two column labeled "Search Method" and "Search Terms." Each of the options allows the user to
        change which search terms will be used in each search. Once the program is initialized and the desired search terms are selected,
        click "Search" to pull up the desired search in the browser. ##HOPEFULLY A NAV BAR WILL BE ADDED SOON##
    
    c) Coding
        Using the results of the search, the user should attempt to determing a given author's race/ethnicity and gender and select one of 
        the given options from each of the "Gender Coding" and "Race/Ethnicity" columns on the bottom right section of the upper portion of the
        program. Given the nature of the task, "Cannot Determine" is an available option for both gender and race/ethnicity. After making the 
        appropriate decision for both gender and race/ethnicity, the user should click "Submit" to finalize the coding for that author. An
        "undo" button is available in the top right portion of the program to undo the last coding.

    d) Finalizing and saving work
        At the end of the coding session, click "Quit/Compile" to save your work into the "complete.csv" file. This process will delete
        "database.csv" and place all work that still needs to be done into "to_code.csv." After the files have appeared or updated (this 
        process takes a few seconds) close the program entirely before starting again.
