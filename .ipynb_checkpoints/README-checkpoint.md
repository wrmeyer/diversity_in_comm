# coding_gui
GUI designed to assist with race and gender coding

Uses Tkinter and Selenium web driver to assist with curation of database of authors
from communication research journals.

This database exists to bring attention to communications researchers from underrepresented communities
as a matter of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Allows for coding of both race and gender.
